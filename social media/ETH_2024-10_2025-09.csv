ethereum,1iuw5ff,2025-02-21 17:18:07,"The crypto exchange ByBit has been hacked, and roughly $1.5 billion in Ethereum (ETH) has been stolen — making this one of the biggest hacks in history."," On Feb. 21, the crypto trading platform stated on social media platform X that it detected unauthorized activity involving one of its Ethereum cold wallets.  According to the firm:  “The incident occurred when our ETH multisig cold wallet executed a transfer to our warm wallet. Unfortunately, this transaction was manipulated through a sophisticated attack that masked the signing interface, displaying the correct address while altering the underlying smart contract logic.  As a result, the attacker was able to gain control of the affected ETH cold wallet and transfer its holdings to an unidentified address.”  While the exchange did not reveal the total amount stolen, on-chain data shows that the attacker siphoned 401,346.76 ETH (worth approximately $1 billion).  Meanwhile, blockchain analysis firm Lookonchain stated that the stolen assets involved around $1.5 billion in different assets, including staked Ethereum.  The platform added that the suspicious address has already begun swapping the stolen funds for ETH.  https://cryptoslate.com/bybit-suffers-1-5-billion-ethereum-heist-in-cold-wallet-breach/",OldUniversity9799,794,279,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1iuw5ff/the_crypto_exchange_bybit_has_been_hacked_and/,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1iuw5ff/the_crypto_exchange_bybit_has_been_hacked_and/

ethereum,1khr5ey,2025-05-08 14:14:00,ETH is a store of value and scaling Ethereum will make it undeniable,"As we scale on L1 and L2, there's a couple things to keep in mind about how it affects ETH, tokenomics, and how it's viewed by the world:  1. As L1 gas limits and blobs increase, the deflationary threshold decreases proportionally. For example, right now the L1 gas limit is at 36M and the deflationary threshold it 14.5 gwei. At a 300M gas limit the deflationary threshold becomes 1.74 gwei (14.5gwei\*36M/300M). 2. As it becomes cheaper to use L1 and L2, that scaling creates potential/opportunity for new/different usecases which increases demand. For example, [this game](https://x.com/megaeth_labs/status/1913249693196599615) or [this game](https://x.com/IAmNickDodson/status/1919762394797982135) where every action is onchain is a new possibility that will fill in **low** cost blockspace. Unbanked usecases like subscriptions and payment streams such as access to games, blogs, licensing (music, shows, patents, trademarks), services (food delivery, hosting), rentals (physical goods), etc will consume **medium** cost blockspace. Complex compounded defi strategies and arbitrage will consume **high** cost blockspace. 3. As Ethereum scales and gas prices become lower, the willingness to pay a demand premium increases. For example, if normal gas prices are $0.01 a user will be much more willing to opay a 100% demand premium ($0.02) at times of higher congestion than they would pre-scaling ($5 -> $10). The lower prices get, the more price insensitive people become to congestion pricing. 4. These previous 3 points will lead to a substantial increase in burn rate, increasing scarcity and demand of ETH. Increased acceptance and usage of defi will further increase demand for ETH as a credibly neutral and permissionless collateral. 5. 30% of ETH supply is locked in staking to secure the network and the activity on top of it, further increasing scarcity and demand for ETH. 6. As Ethereum scales and the world comes onchain, this increased demand for ETH will secure it's place as a store of value and carry immense monetary premium.  ETH is digital gold, digital oil, and internet bond all in one and it will be valued appropriately.

ethereum,1khshk8,2025-05-08 15:09:59,"New Ethereum narrative: ""ETH is Smart Digital Gold"" — and Why It Matters","Ethereum has outgrown its old narratives — and it's time we updated the way we communicate its value.  Let me break it down:  ETH = Smart Digital Gold  It’s intuitive. Catchy. Easy to explain.  People already understand what digital gold means thanks to Bitcoin. But Ethereum goes beyond that — it’s programmable, versatile, and smart.  Old narratives have served their purpose,but they don't stick with the average person.Heres why:  • ""Ethereum is digital oil"" Who wants to invest in oil?  • ""Ethereum is money""Money doesn’t appreciate or excite.  • ""Ethereum is a triple-point asset"" Too abstract,too long.  Think of it like this:  Ethereum is to Bitcoin what a smartphone is to a basic phone.  You don’t need to know how a smartphone works to recognize its power. Same with Ethereum — you don’t need to understand smart contracts to see the apps, stablecoins, NFTs, rollups, and the ecosystem it enables.  Ethereum is:  • A store of value • A capital-generating asset • A platform for DeFi, NFTs, and more • Constantly evolving  It’s not just digital gold — it’s smart digital gold.  Why this narrative works:  • It’s sticky and accessible • It captures Ethereum’s value and its potential • It aligns with modern tech (smartphones, smart homes, etc.) • It positions Ethereum next to — but above — Bitcoin in utility  This is the elevator pitch we’ve been missing.  Ethereum isn’t just oil, or passive money. It’s smart value for the internet age.  PD.

ethereum,1jja457,2025-03-25 03:21:16,ETH Token Utility Is Deteriorating: A Rollup-Centric Ethereum Needs Rethinking,"This is not a price discussion about ETH token —this post focuses on Ethereum's evolving architecture and how current design choices affect ETH’s role within the protocol.  Specifically, I wanted to discuss (hopefully with Ethereum Foundation members and the community here) how Ethereum’s shift toward a rollup-centric architecture—combined with sequencer economics and abstracted fee mechanisms—is steadily eroding the utility of ETH as a protocol asset. As transaction execution moves off-chain and value accrues to application and infrastructure layers, ETH is becoming economically obsolete within its own ecosystem, reduced to a passive settlement token with declining relevance.  \_  Ethereum’s recent market underperformance reflects underlying architectural and economic challenges—namely, an increasing divergence between protocol-level activity and value accrual to the ETH token. As Ethereum transitions toward a modular architecture, with execution increasingly offloaded to Layer 2 rollups and sidechains, the locus of network activity and fee generation is shifting away from the base layer. This raises critical questions about ETH’s function as a utility and capital asset within a system where settlement and data availability remain on L1, but economic activity is abstracted and fragmented across secondary layers.  Layer 2 networks and Ethereum-adjacent sidechains increasingly leverage Ethereum’s ecosystem—its security model, TVL, and EVM compatibility—while largely bypassing ETH as a core economic asset. These platforms benefit from Ethereum’s ecosystem, but redirect liquidity, transaction volume, and value accrual to their own native tokens and network.  Polygon, for example, positioned itself early on as an Ethereum scaling solution and received support from Ethereum Foundation + Vitalik. However, its architecture relies on its own validators, consensus model, and token (MATIC/POL), which is used for both transaction fees and staking. As a result, Polygon leeches from Ethereum's network, TVL, and developer network without reinforcing ETH as a utility token or contributing to the security of Ethereum mainnet.  L2 solutions such as Base, Arbitrum, and Optimism are structurally closer to Ethereum, in that they settle data to Layer 1. However, their economic models often do not reinforce ETH demand in a meaningful way. Sequencers collect fees and periodically post transaction data to Ethereum mainnet using ETH or their own native UI currencies—but in many cases (e.g., Coinbase’s Base), this ETH is sold immediately. The result is an increase in ETH-denominated sell pressure for using a L2 network without any corresponding increase in demand or utility. The amount of ETH burned is extremely small compared to the value being moved across these L2s. For billions in daily transaction volume, the total ETH burned is typically in the hundreds to low thousands per month. So while ETH is used, it’s economically disproportionate to the scale of activity happening off-chain.  Moreover, the abstraction of ETH from end users further erodes its role as a utility token. If rollups and applications can operate entirely using other network-specific tokens, and if ETH is only used behind the scenes (and immediately sold), its function as a transactional or capital asset becomes increasingly marginal. In effect, ETH risks being reduced to a mere settlement token for rollup operators, rather than a broadly used currency or store of value within the ecosystem.  The Ethereum Foundation continues to champion a rollup-centric roadmap as the path toward scalable, decentralized infrastructure. While this model offers tangible benefits—lower transaction costs/higher throughput—it also creates new economic trade-offs. Value accrual shifts to application and infrastructure layers, rather than consolidating around the base protocol asset (ETH). This is a departure from Ethereum’s earlier design assumptions, where ETH was envisioned as a multi-functional asset: the native gas token, staking collateral, medium of exchange, and reserve currency for decentralized applications.  As a long-time participant in the Ethereum ecosystem (since 2015-2016 or so), I’ve observed this shift with increasing concern—not due to a lack of technical progress, but due to the weakening alignment between protocol growth and ETH value. Ethereum is scaling, but ETH is not capturing the upside of that scale. Competing ecosystems—such as Solana or vertically integrated L1s—are increasingly offering tighter economic alignment between usage and token utility, which may present challenges to Ethereum’s long-term competitiveness.  This is a critical juncture. Ethereum must balance scalability with economic coherence. If Ethereum becomes primarily a settlement layer for EVM-compatible rollups that abstract away ETH, then ETH’s utility—and by extension, its long-term value proposition—will disappear.  \_  TL;DR: ETH is being abstracted away from Ethereum network + ecosystem usage, and needs to be fixed.  I'm highlighting a critical design problem where there’s a growing disconnect between network expansion and economic incentives for the ETH token.  This is fundamentally an architectural/incentive issue that needs to be addressed to preserve ETH’s role (the token ETH not the network) in the new age of a rollup-centric ethereum, (and not be completely abstracted away)  in the comments I've outlined potential solutions—such as ETH-denominated fee-sharing models and collateral requirements for L2 sequencers—that would re-align ETH with L2 usage. Today, the Ethereum Ecosystem is growing, but ETH utility continues deteriorate as the token is sidelined from actual transaction flow and user interaction on l2s.",MineETH,39,99,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1jja457/eth_token_utility_is_deteriorating_a/,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1jja457/eth_token_utility_is_deteriorating_a/

At the current price, that would give me around 20 ETH.  My mindset is long term I’m not here to flip for a quick gain. I’d be holding for at least 3–4 years, maybe more, no matter what the market does in the short run.  Here’s the dilemma: part of me says just buy spot, keep it simple, and ride out the cycles. Another part of me wonders if it makes sense to add a little leverage, not crazy, just enough to increase my exposure and potentially amplify gains if ETH does what many believe it will in the next cycle. I know leverage cuts both ways, so I’m trying to figure out if it’s smarter to stay safe or take the risk while I’m young.  I’ve also thought about diversification, but honestly I haven’t studied other cryptocurrencies in detail and ETH is the one I understand best. That’s why I’m leaning toward concentrating everything here rather than spreading myself too thin across projects I don’t fully know.  So convince me: Why is Ethereum the best place to put my savings? Why is now the time to go all-in? And if you were me, would you stick with pure spot or risk a bit of leverage to go bigger?

ethtrader,1n87dkx,2025-09-04 11:19:01,The case for ETH going to $12k.. or even $62k.,"Tom Lee (from Fundstrat) thinks there is a big chance ETH could hit $62k. Milk Road's Twitter account did an analysis to verify the possibility of this prediction happening. If Bitcoin climbs to $250k then ETH's value depends on its ratio to BTC. Over the last 8 years that ratio was on average 0.048. At that ratio level ETH is worth around $12k (if BTC goes to $250k). If it goes back to the 2021 high of 0.087, we get $22k.  Tom Lee says that is not all. Ethereum is turning into the backbone of finance, like the foundation for payments and banking. If it replaces old systems the ratio pumps to 0.25, pushing ETH all the way up to $62k. How does that sound? I like this idea xD. Right now Ethereum leads in DeFi with about 60% of the locked value, over $153 billion this year. Sure, there are still competitors like Ripple or Solana, Cardano.. but look at Ethereum's growth.  One might wonder if this is too optimistic. First Bitcoin needs to rally and the market changes fast. Still if Ethereum keeps building, this target is not impossible if you really think about it. If you believe this is possible it could change how you invest.  *Source: https://x.com/MilkRoadDaily/status/1963001300951695419*",MasterpieceLoud4931,257,188,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1n87dkx/the_case_for_eth_going_to_12k_or_even_62k/,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1n87dkx/the_case_for_eth_going_to_12k_or_even_62k/

Well… here we are. $4,002.97 – and climbing.  Ethereum has finally reclaimed the $4K mark, not on hype or wild speculation, but on solid fundamentals and growing institutional confidence. The landscape has shifted massively since the 2021 bull run. Back then, it was retail FOMO, NFT mania, and shaky DeFi projects propping up prices. Now? We’re seeing *real* adoption: scaling solutions delivering cheaper transactions, ETH’s supply becoming increasingly deflationary, and a wave of institutional players building on and integrating with the network.  This isn’t just a “pump.” It’s the result of years of technical progress and strategic positioning. Ethereum has become the backbone of Web3, DeFi, NFTs, and tokenized real-world assets – and it’s attracting serious money.  The trajectory is clear: stronger fundamentals, deeper liquidity, and a maturing ecosystem. The noise of the last cycle has faded, replaced with a more robust, long-term vision.  Buckle up.

ethtrader,1kdzdpb,2025-05-03 18:15:30,Why is Ethereum doing so insanely bad,"Hi everyone,   I'm new to the crypto space and looking to buy my first positions. Over the past few weeks, I’ve spent a lot of time researching different projects – and I keep coming back to Ethereum.  I’ve mostly invested in stocks before, and I usually base my decisions on what companies are building for the future or what role they could play long term. Applying the same thinking to crypto, Ethereum stood out to me. Here’s what I’ve found so far:  **Why Ethereum makes sense to me:**  *  Ethereum might be officially classified as a *commodity*, not a *security* – which would open the door for big funds and banks to invest freely * Visa is running a tokenization pilot on Ethereum and plans to go live in 2025, with banks like BBVA involved *  BlackRock is testing a $150 billion tokenized Treasury fund on Ethereum infrastructure *  Ethereum’s staking model + burn mechanism make it potentially deflationary over time *  Ethereum is already being used for real-world asset (RWA) tokenization – stocks, bonds, even real estate  **But here’s my problem:**  Despite all of this, **Ethereum’s price is just SUCK** around $1800. It feels like nothing is moving or better: The price doesn’t reflect what Ethereum is actually capable of.. I’m used to seeing assets go up when the fundamentals are strong, so this makes me hesitant to buy. No matter how much good news comes out about Ethereum, the price just doesn’t move.

ethtrader,1kf8fdf,2025-05-05 10:38:53,Ethereum is going to dominate everything - and no one sees it coming,"I swear, I’ve been ordering nothing but pizza for the past 7 days, my family hates me because I’m ignoring everyone, and I smell like a pig. I’ve been in an absolute rabbit hole for the past week ever since the thought hit me: ""Which cryptocurrency should I invest in?""  Of course, I stumbled across the usual suspects: Solana, Bitcoin, XRP, etc. But one in particular really caught my attention: Ethereum.   How is it possible that Ethereum is the second biggest cryptocurrency, but still feels so ""cheap"" and barely moves in price?  So I started digging.   At first, I ended up on YouTube—like pretty much everyone. YouTubers doing all sorts of chart analysis. At first, it seemed plausible. But then I went back and watched some of their older videos, and guess what? Not a single one of their predictions came even remotely true.  Next, I moved on to crypto news YouTubers. But they all gave off this vibe of ""How do I get the most views the fastest?"" Some of it was informed, yes—but the promises were way too big and way too fast. Not for me. I don’t buy into that.   My motto has always been: Buy, hold, forget, celebrate in 1–3 years.  Naturally, I ended up in some forums. And the opinions on Ethereum couldn’t have been more divided. From “Ethereum is the best thing ever” to “Ethereum is so slow and trash.”   I think people are just frustrated because Ethereum is so volatile.  Up to this point, I guess most people have taken the same path.   And by now, 5 days had already passed.  After that, I made a post in this thread.: ""Why is ETH so undervalued?""   I expected maybe 3–4 replies.   Boom: Over 200 replies. And zero consensus.  That’s when I thought: Why not go straight to the root?  So I started watching tons of interviews with Vitalik from 2020–2025, tracked Ethereum’s development, watched BlackRock interviews—especially with Larry Fink—and looked into how Ethereum has changed over the years.  Ethereum was always cool, but it never focused on marketing. Only a tiny fraction of people even understand what ETH actually is.   But earlier this year, Ethereum launched something called Etherealize—which is aimed specifically at changing that, to finally start marketing Ethereum properly.  All of this, combined with BlackRock saying that everything will be built on ETH, and the fact that other companies also put ETH first, led me to this conclusion:  Ethereum is a caterpillar that’s turning into a GIGA MEGA ULTRA butterfly.  And here’s why I think that:  1. Ethereum realized their public image sucks. They appointed two co-directors to strengthen leadership. 2. Etherealize is actively reaching out to potential clients to pitch Ethereum. 3. BlackRock is backing Ethereum, and in an interview, it was said that other companies also put ETH at the top. 4. Last year, Larry Fink said in an interview that he wants to tokenize all of BlackRock’s assets because he’s convinced that’s the future. 5. This year, Fink repeated in another interview that the SEC needs to hurry up because tokenization would simplify so much. 6. Within just two months, BlackRock poured $2.2 billion into the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund. Before that, they had invested only $600 million over the course of an entire year. 7. Ethereum still holds the largest market share—by far. 8. BlackRock plans to tokenize its $150 billion Treasury Trust Fund. While they didn’t officially say it’ll be on ETH, the signs are obvious. In a recent interview at Etherealize, it was hinted that BlackRock did choose ETH. Also, they previously ran a very successful pilot project on Ethereum. 9. Other companies are jumping on the ETH bandwagon too. 10. The president’s son literally said it’s a good time to buy ETH—even when it was still over $2K.  Okay… there’s a lot more I could say.   But those are my core fundamental data points for why I believe ETH is a sleeping giant.  What do you think?   If I’m missing something or misinterpreting any of this, feel free to call it out.

ethtrader,1nezd1q,2025-09-12 10:15:27,Michael Saylor accidentally explained why Ethereum wins.,"Michael Saylor has always been Bitcoin's biggest supporter. For years he talked about how BTC is the ultimate store of value, digital gold that does not need yield at all. An interesting old clip came up where Saylor admits something ironic: if he put $100 billion in Bitcoin and it generates 0% return, it is no different than holding bonds that pay nothing. In his own words.. that makes it a 'non-performing asset.'  Etheraider (Ethereum community member) commented on this clip on Twitter, saying what many of us already know: Saylor wishes Bitcoin was more like Ethereum. Ethereum staking changed everything.. instead of just holding and hoping price goes up ETH holders can earn yield directly from the network. That yield is native, secured by the protocol and it keeps capital productive. Meanwhile Bitcoin still offers no return at all. Let's look at the bigger picture, this is not just Saylor talking. Institutions are moving to crypto and they want assets that work for them. That is why Ethereum is the best choice.  If even Bitcoin's biggest believer recognized the problem then maybe it is time to admit it: Ethereum is doing what Bitcoin cannot do. That is exactly why it is winning.  *Source: https://x.com/etheraider/status/1965451308426825943*",MasterpieceLoud4931,258,134,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1nezd1q/michael_saylor_accidentally_explained_why/,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1nezd1q/michael_saylor_accidentally_explained_why/

DCinvestor posted a tweet that got me thinking, the biggest financial players are starting to build on Ethereum, and it is about to change everything. We are talking literally big banks and institutions coming to Ethereum, using the blockchain for DeFi and tokenization. This all points out that this will be the future of finance. A report from XBTO back in April this year already pointed this out, showing how Ethereum's adoption is growing, and it is growing really fast, even if the price has not caught up yet.. but it will.    Yet people here on Reddit and even on Twitter are still trashing ETH, calling it a bad investment while Bitcoin is slowly losing its dominance. Bitcoin might feel 'safer' but Ethereum's potential is being slept on.  DCinvestor's tweet should be a wake-up call. In a year we are going to look back and realize this was the turning point. Mark my words, ETH investors are going to be the ones saying, 'I told you so' while the doubters struggle to catch up. Ethereum has the best fundamentals in crypto and the price will follow. This is just the beginning.

ethtrader,1khufqf,2025-05-08 16:29:41,Ethereum shuts down the FUD.. again.,"As we all know, Ethereum just pulled off its massive Pectra upgrade yesterday.. and guess what? It went off without any issues, completely flawless, smooth, and honestly this is a big middle finger to all the FUD spreaders out there. 0xCygaar, a software engineer for the Abstract chain, said on Twitter Pectra was like 'upgrading an airplane's engines mid flight,' and he is right. A decentralized network like Ethereum, with thousands of nodes worldwide, just upgraded 11 major improvements and without even blinking. Meanwhile centralized systems can barely update their servers without crashing, do you see the difference here?   The haters always say Ethereum is too slow, too clunky, or cannot scale. Pectra just doubled blob capacity for L2 scaling, made wallets better and improved user experience a lot. User experience is what is most criticized in the Ethereum ecosystem, and that is what is being improved.  The cherry on top is ETH's price pumped hard after the upgrade, proving the market believes in Ethereum's future. Centralized setups choke under single points of failure while Ethereum's decentralized technology keeps shining. The core devs are the best and they get almost zero praise most days. So to the FUD crowd: Ethereum is laughing all the way to the moon, maybe it is time to stop doubting and start believing.  *0xCygaar's tweet: x.com/0xCygaar/status/1920139116345168261*",MasterpieceLoud4931,465,118,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1khufqf/ethereum_shuts_down_the_fud_again/,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1khufqf/ethereum_shuts_down_the_fud_again/

Then, I run it through my model, which layers several signals together:  * **Momentum (RSI – Relative Strength Index):** Gauges if the market is running hot or cooling off. * **Volatility (RVI – Relative Volatility Index):** Measures whether recent swings are driven more by buyers or sellers. * **Baseline (Moving Average, e.g., 200 days):** Tracks the “fair value” price to see if ETH is stretched above or below its trend. * **Recency weighting:** Gives more importance to recent data so the score adapts to current conditions. * **Trend smoothing:** Filters out noise from short-term spikes, keeping the score stable and reliable.  The calculation in concept:  Risk Score \~ (log(Price) − log(Moving Average)) x (RSI Adjustment) x (RVI Adjustment) x (Recency Weight) x (Trend Smoothing)  \-> scaled to 0–100.

ethtrader,1mo6alf,2025-08-12 11:37:42,Ethereum is breaking its old limits!!,"ETH's past bull runs were huge but they also hit a wall. In 2017 the ICO hype flooded the network which made the fees very high. In 2021 NFTs did the exact same thing. Each time high costs limited network activity, so they were a soft cap on how far ETH could go.  This cycle things are very different. As DCinvestor points out on Twitter, most on-chain activity moved to Ethereum's L2 networks. L2s take care of transactions faster and cheaper so now the base layer is not limited like before. This thing alone already removes a big cap on Ethereum's growth. The other change is just as important: demand for ETH is no longer coming only from on-chain activity. Treasury companies and ETFs are entering the scene and they are creating huge demand that is unaffected by gas fees or network congestion.  But what does this mean?? Together these changes mean we are heading into uncharted territory. The limits that kept ETH in chains before are gone. With more capacity, lower costs and new demand sources this bull market could make ETH go far higher than most are expecting. This will be a different cycle, it is the first one where Ethereum can really scale and that makes the upside harder to measure and easier to underestimate.

The sec just gave us a massive gift  the sec dropped guidance defining liquid staking, and the market is reading this as a green light for eth etfs with staking rewards. imagine institutional money not just buying eth, but earning staking rewards on top of it.  this could be the catalyst that finally breaks bitcoin dominance.  speaking of bitcoin dominance...  btc dominance dropped from 60% to 57% in august while a single whale selling $2.7 billion worth of bitcoin caused a flash crash that liquidated $500 million in leveraged positions.  think about that. one whale dumping caused chaos in bitcoin markets while ethereum is hitting transaction records and building institutional infrastructure.  the psychology shift is happening  qcp capital said it perfectly: ""if ether etfs with staking get approval, it could feed the narrative that eth will outperform soon.""  we're seeing the early signs:  institutional staking infrastructure being built  transaction volume at yearly highs    30% of supply locked in staking  regulatory clarity improving  bitcoin whales getting shaky  institutional money is choosing sides  while bitcoin treasury companies are still buying (strategy grabbed 3,511 btc, metaplanet got 1,859 btc), the real story is what's happening to ethereum's supply.  bitcoin has infinite sellers. ethereum is systematically removing supply from circulation through staking.  the numbers don't lie  ethereum processes 1.8m transactions at peak vs bitcoin's ~300k daily average. eth has 30% of supply staked vs bitcoin's ~0%. ethereum is building the infrastructure for institutional staking while bitcoin whales are panic selling billions.  meanwhile bitcoin dominance is sliding and eth etfs with staking could be coming soon.  my take: this is the setup everyone's been waiting for  we're watching ethereum build the foundation for institutional adoption while bitcoin deals with whale dumps and regulatory uncertainty around mining.  the narrative is shifting from ""digital gold"" to ""productive digital asset."" ethereum pays yield, processes real economic activity, and is building the rails for web3.  bitcoin is starting to look like expensive digital rock while ethereum is becoming digital oil - powering an entire economy.  the flippening isn't some meme anymore  when 30% of eth supply is staked, transaction volume hits yearly highs, and institutional staking infrastructure is being built, while bitcoin whales are dumping billions...  maybe it's time to admit that ethereum is winning the institutional adoption race.  what do you think? are we seeing the early stages of the flippening, or is this just another temporary shift in market dynamics?

ethtrader,1kh56pn,2025-05-07 18:47:36,Ethereum Just Upgraded. The Market Yawned.,"I've seen a few comments today from people complaining that Ethereum's price isn’t moving after the update. But honestly, I expected this. The masses aren't really into Ethereum like that. We're a small group of niche nerds who follow these upgrades closely – the average person doesn’t even know this happened. But let’s not forget: most people don’t see the big picture. So let’s break it down, one by one:  **What the Pectra Upgrade Actually Changes**  1. **More ETH per Validator** → Institutions can now stake more ETH per validator (from 32 ETH to 2048 ETH). Easier for big players. 2. **Smart Wallets**  → Wallets can now act like smart contracts. Pay gas with any token, bundle transactions, better security. 3. **More Data per Block** → Ethereum can now handle twice the ""blob"" data. That helps Layer-2s scale faster and cheaper. 4. **Better User Experience (under the hood)** → Several technical improvements make Ethereum smoother for developers and future upgrades.  Big companies move slowly, and it will take time to sell this to them. On top of that, the lack of a clear classification from the SEC remains a major risk factor. BUT — if Ethereum is officially classified as a commodity, I'm confident: there will be no holding it back. And honestly, the signs are looking good.

It is the original, the brand name, the ""digital gold"" that Wall Street has embraced with massive ETF inflows but there is a quiet shift happening under the surface and it could end up giving Ethereum the upper hand.  As you probably know since their launch Bitcoin ETFs has pulled in more than $56.8 billion while Ethereum ETFs even if they started months later have already attracted around $26.8 billion. On first sight, Bitcoin still looks dominant but when you compare those inflows to the size of each network the story flips. For Bitcoin, that $56.8B equals to just 2.6% of its market cap. However for Ethereum, $26.8B represents 5.3%. In other words, every dollar going into ETH has nearly twice the market impact compared to BTC.  This difference is important because Ethereum is not just a store of value, it is a yield bearing and programmable economy. Investors are not buying ETH for the price, they are also buying access to staking rewards, tokenized assets and a network that keeps evolving with real world apps. Wall Street see this and their growing interest suggest that ETH may be positioned for stronger relative performance.  When this happens, it often marks the early stages of an alt season. Are we close to see a surge on ETH with its proper insane alt season later?

Even thought ETH hasn't reached a new price ATH yet, Ethereum keeps evolving in all its aspects and it is scaling horizontally. Billions are flowing across rollups, DeFi is becoming active again and even NFTs are trying to resurrect again.  FUD narratives like Ethereum is too slow and expensive, L2s are killing Ethereum, are dying. Gas fees on L2s are pennies and builders are back. Devs never left.  A new Era is being built in front of our eyes and it is our duty to take advantage to try to improve our lives the best we can correctly deciding where we put our money.

ethtrader,1ltse0l,2025-07-07 12:04:37,Corporations might ditch Bitcoin for Ethereum.,"Nett0eth, an Ethereum content creator, posted a long thread on Twitter talking about the 'ETH Strategy'. The ETH Strategy, eth_strategy on Twitter, is a DeFi protocol that is 'saving Ethereum.' This is inspired by MicroStrategy's Bitcoin strategy and the system lets users deposit stablecoins to gain leveraged Ethereum exposure but without liquidation risks. It uses a mix of 4.2-year convertible debt and NFT options. This is very useful and I think it is a sign Ethereum is destined to outshine Bitcoin in the corporate world.  ETH Strategy connects with Ethereum's ecosystem. ETF approvals and the L2 hype are making it a magnet for institutions. Ethereum gives staking yields and all of this combined means Ethereum offers utility Bitcoin cannot possibly match. Ethereum is not only just a store of value, it also supports apps, stablecoins, and real-world assets. The protocol's transparency gives corporations a practical reason to jump in.  Bitcoin has static appeal and it is starting to fade away. Ethereum is more versatile, it has leveraged exposure without volatility and this means companies can grow their treasuries. As more institutions adopt ETH Strategy and similar initiatives it is only a matter of time before ETH becomes the institutional crypto of choice. Bitcoin holds the crown now but ETH's utility will take it in the future.

In 2017 and 2020, ETH spent some time in this green area before waking up and leading to a massive bull run that changed lives. Now it is 205 and we are again in the same region.  This is the area where conviction and trust pays. The past has shown us that those who accumulated here saw returns they never imagined.  Now, Ethereum is more mature and has a huge ecosystem on top of it, it has also institutional interest and it is dominating DeFi. The real question is: Will history repeat?  If ETH follows the same path, the next cycle could send it a lot higher than previous all time highs., $15k incoming?

Since it started in 2015, Ethereum has not gone offline once. Not a single crash, no downtime, nothing. That is basically10 years of pure uninterrupted action. This was pointed out by sassal.eth, a well known Ethereum community member, on Twitter.  I mean really think about this. Even big centralized companies like banks or Amazon have outages, but Ethereum?? Never. It does not stop, it just keeps going. But why is it like this? Ethereum's community and developers are always one step ahead. They fix a problem before it even happens.  There is not a single point of failure and that is why it never crashes. Ethereum doesn't even go down during upgrades, as I mentioned in my post yesterday. Meanwhile Solana has been struggling with its faster but fragile model. It had multiple outages since 2020, some actually lasting hours, because of its Proof-of-History system. Solana sacrifices reliability because of its speed. Solana's centralization makes it vulnerable.  Ethereum keeps proving that true decentralization is the key to a network that never sleeps. Solana should take notes, speed means nothing if you are offline. Ethereum may not be perfect yet, but its stability is still unmatched.  *Here is sassal.eth's referenced tweet: x.com/sassal0x/status/1920662735471124664*",MasterpieceLoud4931,256,94,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1kj6og6/ethereum_has_never_gone_offline_solana_cannot_say/,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1kj6og6/ethereum_has_never_gone_offline_solana_cannot_say/

Here’s why ETH is the lowest risk highest reward long term investment in crypto:   Asset Tokenization: Ethereum is the go-to blockchain for tokenizing everything – from real estate to stocks. Think about owning a fraction of your favorite building or a piece of a Picasso. ETH is at the center of it all. You might wanna pay attention to this one.  Institutions Are Flocking: While the skeptics keep calling it a bubble, big institutions are quietly stacking ETH. They’re catching on to the tokenization trend, and billions are about to flow in. But, sure, keep doubting it.  Bear Market is the Chance of a lifetime: Sure, it feels bearish right now, but guess what? The best opportunities come when everyone else is scared. While you’re sitting on the sidelines, I’m loading up. Trust me, this is where the real money is made.  ETH Won’t Be Stopped: Remember all those so-called “Ethereum killers” from 2017 and 2021? Yeah, they’re all dead now. Ethereum’s got the most developers, the most projects, and the most adoption. It’s gonna capture well over 20% of the crypto market cap in time, and those still betting against it will get left behind. Whatever chains are in the top 10 today will be long gone by then and ETH will be well over 10k, 20k,40k, etc….  Sure, keep trying to time the market, but long-term? Ethereum is gonna be like buying Microsoft in 1985. I’m stacking FETH in my HSA and Roth IRA for those sweet tax-free gains, plus stacking ETH in my hardware wallet for the long haul. Those who are a woe is me eth is a stable coin… zoom out. The long term trend will only continue. Keep trying to time the market and keep sleeping on it, though. I’ll be the one laughing later.

Yesterday he posted a video on Twitter and in that video Leo calls this Ethereum's 'iPhone moment.' The United States government is now publishing economic data on-chain using Chainlink, through the Bureau of Economic Analysis. That means that key indicators are being pushed directly to Ethereum and the L2's. The goal is to get more transparency and less financial black boxes.  At the same time Ethereum's stablecoin growth is pulling away from the L1 competitors. Solana's market cap for stablecoins is crabbing at $11 billion, while Ethereum's keeps growing. Clearly the growth of Ethereum's competitors is capped, that difference shows how strong Ethereum's effects became. Leo also says that new L1 blockchains will not last as true competitors. Instead they will likely pivot to Ethereum L2's, joining an infrastructure that already works. It is a lot easier to build on Ethereum than to fight against it.  Put all of this together and you see why Leo calls this a supercycle. Institutions are on Ethereum, liquidity is coming back, RWA's and trillions in stablecoins are moving on-chain.

One Ethereum community member called stakeyour.eth on Twitter posted a tweet about why ETH underperformed for years. People trashed Ethereum, betting on Solana flipping it or chasing meme coins but the truth is ETH's strength is in its quiet build, the fundamentals, not hype. From 2015 to 2024 developers focused on a solid decentralized foundation without any need for aggressive marketing.. just work. And now with TradFi coming in you finally start to see the payoff.  Chalom's move from BlackRock to co-lead a company holding a lot of ETH shows big money believes in it. In stakeyour.eth's post you can see images showing 2020-2024 as a chaotic 'market' of VCs and gamblers. But in 2025 it gets a lot better: TradFi adoption, real capital and a mature network. Ethereum's transaction fees were behind Bitcoin's, proving early neglect of fundamentals. Fees were often higher and less efficient compared to Bitcoin at that time and this gap showed us Ethereum was not optimizing its core tech, like speed and cost-effectiveness.  You should not buy the bandwagon excuse some traders use now, if you stuck with ETH you saw its potential. Ethereum is not about about price chasing. It is about a decade of patience coming along and making progress.

ethtrader,1nk63ys,2025-09-18 11:50:12,Even ETH maxis admit Bitcoin could hit $200k. Ethereum's value is not measured in price targets.,"Something very ironic is that even the biggest Ethereum supporters are saying that Bitcoin can go to $200k. On Twitter a self-described ETH maxi called materkel.eth says the reason BTC can go to that price is that crypto has never seen this kind of institutional demand. With Wall Street entering the game BTC's price action looks secondary.  The point here is what stands out is not the prediction itself but the attitude. You can criticize networks without turning it into an online warfare. Too often discussions about Ethereum x Bitcoin, or any other chain really, get reduced to mudslinging over coin prices. In his tweet materkel.eth makes a point that matters, the performance of individual coins today is a small piece of a much bigger story. Ethereum has never been about chasing the charts, it is about building the ground for a new financial system. Whether BTC goes to $200k, $300k or even higher it does not change what Ethereum is set up to do, which is to reshape global markets with a programmable and decentralized base layer.  Both coins can win in their own lanes and if institutions keep buying in then they likely will. The difference most people need to understand is that Ethereum's upside goes beyond 'number go up', it is about changing how money itself works.  *Source: https://x.com/materkel/status/1968242673115881836*",MasterpieceLoud4931,111,71,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1nk63ys/even_eth_maxis_admit_bitcoin_could_hit_200k/,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1nk63ys/even_eth_maxis_admit_bitcoin_could_hit_200k/
ethtrader,1ktgjuc,2025-05-23 10:53:16,"Ethereum will hit $100k in the next 4 Years, here is why:","Hear me out:  One of the obvious drivers is staking. As more ETH gets staked, it becomes locked and unavailable for trading. This isn’t just theoretical scarcity — it’s enforced illiquidity. But let’s be honest: staking is just one piece of the puzzle. Yes, it restricts supply. Yes, it’s sticky. But it’s not the core reason Ethereum can hit $100K. It’s a small stone in a much larger foundation.  If you look across different charts and macro trends, one thing becomes crystal clear:  Ethereum is becoming the base layer for tokenized real-world assets — government bonds, real estate, equities, stablecoins, and more. Institutional players and fintech platforms are building on Ethereum. And that matters. For finance to operate on a global scale, it needs trustless, permissionless, borderless infrastructure. Ethereum is the only serious option right now that checks all those boxes.  Yes, there’s still the regulatory overhang — how will Ethereum be classified? But come on. The signals from the SEC are positive. The U.S. government has a clear incentive to classify ETH as a commodity. BlackRock wants it to be a commodity. The entire financial world is leaning in that direction. And even if it takes time — the trajectory is clear.  Meanwhile, institutions are beginning to treat ETH not just as a protocol — but as a balance sheet asset. Just look at Coinbase: they now hold ETH in their treasury. This is only the beginning. As more corporations start adding ETH as a reserve asset, it unlocks a completely new demand layer — and further anchors Ethereum as the monetary base of tokenized finance.  To reach $100K per ETH, we’d need somewhere around $10–12 trillion in real-world assets to be tokenized. That may sound bold, but it’s not crazy — it’s actually realistic. The global bond market alone is over $130 trillion. Even a small fraction migrating on-chain gives ETH explosive upside.  Hate me all you want — but I believe in this.  We're going to make it. We're going to be millionaires.

That move triggered a chain reaction of institutional interest in BTC and helped to send it to new highs. Now, Ethereum is getting its MicroStrategy moment.  A new wave of corporate treasures is aggressively buying ETH. Not because it is cool, not because it is trendy, they are buying it because ETH is the backbone of DeFi and they know that it will move the world in the near future.  As you can see in the image above:  * SharpLink started it with over $1B in ETH, including $213M in a single week.  * Bitmine quickly one upped them with $1.1B in holdings.   And more will come soon for sure. Institutional FOMO just started. Ethereum supply on exchanges is crashing to levels not seen since 2016 + upcoming trillions in tokenized assets, stablecoins and now the GENIUS Act clearing legal pathways for all... well things are going to heat up soon.

ethtrader,1legsin,2025-06-18 13:14:00,Why the silence on Ethereum? Big players are holding back and it is weird.,"The well-known Ethereum educator and investor sassal.eth posted a very interesting tweet yesterday. He said, and I quote, that 'this whole Coinbase doesn't have to talk about Ethereum thing is just dumb.' Ethereum has been at the center of some of the biggest moves in crypto, especially recently. Yet the silence from big players like Coinbase, BlackRock, and even Trump is weird.  Let's take Coinbase, they own 137,000 ETH, run a top-tier staking service and on top of that they created Base, an Ethereum L2 that handles millions of transactions every month. Coinbase put serious money into ETH and yet they barely hype it. BlackRock is another example, they have the iShares Ethereum Trust ETF but do not talk about ETH often or at all. Even Trump, he is very involved in crypto now. Trump never talked about ETH despite better regulations that are good for not only Ethereum but the entire crypto sector. And he obviously holds ETH too!!  This silence feels very weird, these giants have a lot invested in Ethereum, financially and infrastructurally. But they are not talking about Ethereum's potential. So.. are they focusing on the long-term, accumulating ETH under the radar before going bullish?? Or is this strategic and they are avoiding competition? They could be wary of regulatory pushback or just don't want to ruin everything. Whatever the reason it is frustrating. Ethereum is eco-friendly and has staking rewards, because of this alone it should be front-page news. This silence hints at secret reasons, and as an ETH fan I have to ask why are they not sharing ETH vocally when they have so much to gain?

People flooded the comments calling me a noob, saying beginners don’t know anything, etc. To this day, I still don’t understand what a beginner is supposed to do wrong in traditional market analysis. Turns out, the ones calling me a beginner were probably beginners themselves.  Anyway, since then, the price has more than doubled. 130%+ in 3 months - not too bad, right?  But I believe this is just the beginning - the beginning of a rally that Ethereum is about to go on. We haven’t even put our shoes on yet. How do I know that? Weeks of research on top of everything I’d already done back then.  I come from traditional stock trading, and ever since Trump got elected, I’ve been diving deeper and deeper into crypto. Ethereum is going to be the next financial backbone of the U.S. - that’s where this is headed. Whether the price hits 10k, 20k, or 30k honestly doesn’t matter to me. Ethereum will always have a permanent place in my portfolio. From here on out, it's only up.  My personal price target is still $80k - and yeah, I know a lot of people think I’m crazy for saying that. I don’t care. They thought I was crazy at $1600 too. So who’s gonna be laughing in the end?

Even Bitcoin, the OG of crypto took double the time.  Most people know Ethereum as “that crypto with smart contracts and NFTs,” but here’s a stat that puts things into perspective: it just became the *fastest major asset in history* to hit a **$500 billion market cap.**  This is not just a random milestone. This highlights how crypto and Ethereum is the fastest growing asset class ever created. We are watching the birth of a financial system that grows at internet speed. Ethereum is not just digital money, it is becoming the base layer for everything in the future, from DeFi, NFTs, gaming, DAOs, etc. Everything will be on top of Ethereum ecosystem.  Skeptics usually dismiss crypto as hype but the numbers are just brutal facts. Adoption curves are accelerating and capital is flowing so fast.

Since its peak, ETH/BTC dropped 69.17%. Currently at 0.023, there is a lot of bearish pressure over time. Investors are losing interest in ETH.  The good part is that in the past this was a support that indicated the potential floor, where there is a possibility of buying pressure returning, so a reversal may be about to happen soon. ETH/BTC is very undervalued, which could attract investors and long-term holders, so maybe this is the confirmation of the bottom. Market sentiment is also at multi-year lows. There are a lot of posts indicating that Ethereum sentiment is very low, and this is also usually a sign of the bottom. When pessimism peaks, a recovery might happen afterward because fear selling will exhaust itself.  My verdict is that this could make ETH outperform BTC once recovery begins.

This for now is a rumor and not confirmed but it makes total sense.  https://preview.redd.it/nhwzays2kh0f1.png?width=300&format=png&auto=webp&s=e612b59bfbbc9ea59d274f615a8ec6cb3d8295b8  Like the rumors say, Meta is planning to launch stablecoins on Ethereum network and it makes total sense because long time ago Facebook already danced with his own stablecoin called LIBRA which disappeared more or less 5 years ago, same with the Metaverse they created that it is probably dead or in the freezer xD  Well, this project 100% made Zuck learn a lot and I am 100% sure that they learned that managing their own everything is more expensive than using an already existing chain. The king of stablecoins is Ethereum network and currently developing a new stablecoin on it reduce a lot the costs and make you jump in the market fast and with a lot of security because Ethereum is very strong.  Rumors say that Meta also wants to enable stablecoin payments in their sites and we dont have to forget that Meta has a wide range of apps and that they can bring a more casual adoption type, they own Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, etc. Now with regulations getting more clear and easier, its their time to jump in.  Without no doubt this will be released country by country because of legislation but this will spread through the whole world and call me crazy but I am 100% sure that they will also add an own wallet like Telegram did to easier manage in one place all your apps tokens.  Future is here and as someone that got into crypto in 2021 and the narrative was ""Crypto is for criminals, its going to be banned"", WE WON, WE WERE RIGHT.

ethtrader,1k57l3s,2025-04-22 14:24:03,Whales are betting big on Ethereum. Here’s why you should care.,"Today I was analyzing the social media sentiment about ETH, and during my research I came across an interesting tweet. A 26 year old investor known as 'Crypto Beast' on Twitter made a very bold play. He sold $3 million of his S&P 500 stocks, basically his entire retirement fund, and went all in on Ethereum. He currently has 6,337.375 ETH, worth over $10 million, at least that we know about.  The reason why Crypto Beast did this was because everyone on crypto Twitter is very bearish on ETH, and he sees that as the ultimate buy signal. That is real conviction!! However Crypto Beast isn’t alone. Whales are starting to get bullish on ETH, even as the market sentiment stays negative. A bearish trend usually creates fear, but that is exactly when smart investors 'attack'. Ethereum’s price volatility is a big factor here, making it risky, but it is also a potential goldmine if you time it right.  Crypto Beast is aiming for a 3x return, aiming for $30 million. Other whales are making similar moves, buying millions in ETH despite the trash talk. Meanwhile Ethereum keeps showing it is full of life. So while everyone is fading ETH these whales are doubling down. Are they crazy or onto something huge?? I am definitely ready to ride.

This is not just a blip, its a straight up signal and we are witnessing a level of activity that could soon break all time high. No matter where you do it, deep in DeFi, minting NFTs or just doing some other L2s action, this affects everyone.  This is important because even thought it could be a few persons doing it in really it is more probable that more users, more utility and more adoption is happening. It is not just whales moving ETH around. This is real, real engagement in whole Ethereum ecosystem. Showing again that Ethereum is not dead at all.  This again will not directly affect the price but somehow it is already doing it because those using Ethereum ecosystem probably believe in it and they will probably buy and HODL more. Let see if all the macroeconomics drama is solved and the economy takes a more bullish course.  Every time I check Ethereum adoption and metrics I end being more bullish and believing more on ETH. Am I the only one?

With $219 Billion in total capital secured, Ethereum is the undefeated champ of the blockchain world and this is just the beginning of its journey.  Regarding stablecoins, Ethereum dominates. Most of the world's stablecoin volume lives and flows on Ethereum ecosystem.  Apps? The biggest and baddest dApps are on Ethereum ecosystem too. For example, Uniswap, Aave, Lido, etc. All of the thriving on Ethereum.  RWAs (Real World Assets), Ethereum is also leading the charge. Tokenized treasuries, commodities and even real estate are increasingly choosing Ethereum as their home.  And this is not all, we dont have to forget the network effect. More users bring more devs. More devs bring more tools. More tools bring more use cases. The cycle keeps compounding. Ethereum is building and economic black hole sucking in value from every direction.  Furthermore, L2s like Arbitrum, Optimism and Base and sidechains like Polygon are scaling Ethereum without sacrificing decentralization. It is not just about L1 anymore, it is about the Ethereum ecosystem as a whole.  The king 👑 is secure on his throne. Long live ETH.

Really far away from the second one that is Solana with 533. This is not just a lead, this is total domination. After Solana we have Cosmos with 473. Then we have Foundry, which is part of the Ethereum ecosystem.

This is happening because Ethereum is the most mature L1, with the richest ecosystem and the deepest tooling. Ethereum is becoming the launchpad for everything, from deploying DeFi protocols, to NFT collections or experimenting with DAO and ZK Tech. It is the way to go. Solidity devs are everywhere and they keep being more and more.  Ethereum keeps growing and its layer 2s are also growing and exploding, showing really interesting tools, apps and ideas too.

ethtrader,1nhhgwz,2025-09-15 09:46:53,"No nation can control Ethereum, it is too decentralized to shut down.","In a recent event that Vitalik attended he reminded everyone why Ethereum is different, it is too decentralized for any single nation to control. That is not just a nice slogan, because Ethereum's nodes are spread out across more than 100 countries. What this means is that no switch exists that anyone can flip to shut Ethereum down.  Right now Ethereum is one of the most resilient systems in crypto and it has done that without giving away power to committees or central authorities. That was the whole point right from the start. Some people just love to say Ethereum is centralized or that L2 networks are controlled by insiders or are centralized too. Yet the base layer tells a different story, every L2 still connects back into Ethereum and that foundation is what keeps the system neutral. Vitalik talked about this before and he pushed back against the idea that scalability has to mean giving up decentralization, Ethereum proved time and time again that this is not necessary.  If there is one area Ethereum still needs to push harder and improve, it is privacy. Governments do not go after 'centralized' chains first, they go after privacy tools. What does that tell us??

Especial april was brutal with its lowest valuation compared to BTC in over 5 years.  That got me thinking… is Ethereum really done? Or is this just peak fear?  I went and researched the data to get a better picture of Ethereums potential. In June I finished my analysis and summarised my findings in a report. (you can read it if you have the time, see link)  **In short:**  * Ethereum is the market leader (by far) in stablecoins, RWA and DeFi, even as the market grows fast. * Stablecoins are currently getting a lot of traction (see Circle and Genius Act in the US), and ETH will ride this wave. * Tokenization is also getting increasing hype and grew almost 440% in 18 months, again ETH will ride this wave (companies like Robinhood and Coinbase are working on their L2s to realize 24/7 stocks) * Ethereum operates largely under U.S. regulation, giving it the legitimacy and trust the big institutions need to adopt tokenized assets at scale * Institutions trust Ethereum’s security and are likely to pour more in ETH ETFs once staking funds arrive. * Over half of all ETH is now staked, cutting supply and showing strong conviction. * ETH/BTC is near historic lows, past cycles show this often marks a strong rebound. * Also on-chain data (like MVRV-Z score) suggests ETH is very low valued while growth drivers are still ahead.

This observation is based on [insights from Google Trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&q=Ethereum&hl=en), a tool that analyzes the popularity of search terms over time, giving us a glimpse into public interest and sentiment towards various topics, including cryptocurrencies like Ethereum.  https://preview.redd.it/4maune8tgade1.jpg?width=2361&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=08e3114ed9c7626b5543a6f9f7f9edef398eb5d5  From the chart above we can see that Ethereum's interest level worldwide over the past 5 years is currently rated at 13 which is significantly lower (around 7.7 times down, from the all-time interest level of 100 at the peak of the last bull season in 2021).  This current trend mirrors a pattern observed in 2020 right before ETH rallied hard to a new all-time high in 2021.  https://preview.redd.it/ysqzw00wgade1.jpg?width=2529&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=48d6ebe9a12ef296f21b13315da9c773d41e93bc  What this indicates is that the best opportunities often arise when the general interest is low and that the upcoming rally not only promises to surprise everyone but will likely be resented by those who ignored or underestimated ETH at its current levels.  This isn't mere speculation or hopium but hard facts.   Like Etheraider [reminds us on X](https://x.com/etheraider/status/1876094751776321895):   >""Beginning last bull cycle $ETH had no staking, no burn, no ETFs, barely any L2s, no prediction markets, no AI agents, higher issuance, less users, less dapps, less devs, with a hostile SEC, and was not a commodity. It’s improved in every single one of those metrics. Last cycle $ETH did a 60x from the bottom. If it were to do the same this cycle it would hit $50k.""

You will say now, okay... but well that is not the whole deal, this signal only flashed once in the last cycle back in early 2020 and after that Ethereum absolutely left Bitcoin in the dust for the next two years.  Now in 2025 we are seeing the same exact signal again but with very different fundamentals and a really a more mature Ethereum after amazing updates that made it change from PoW to PoS, reduced the fees a lot with blob technology, more scalable, an exploding L2 ecosystem, institution backed with ETF flows, staking yield, and now even with treasuries.  I don't know you but I have the feeling that this rocket is about to launch.  The trend is reversing, the macro signal is there, the 3W MACD golden cross has landed and we are suppose to get cut rates in September. Looks like Q3 and Q4 are going to be amazing.

ethtrader,1kduzyi,2025-05-03 15:02:24,His bold move saved Ethereum.,"Back in 2017 Vitalik Buterin, the big brain behind Ethereum, saw a disaster coming. Ethereum was his dream of a smarter blockchain, and it was in trouble. A thread on Twitter by StarPlatinum talks about this insane story, showing how Vitalik's decision to switch from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake saved crypto from a $100 billion collapse. I read the thread, and I will break it down.  Ethereum's PoW system was eating up too much energy, think 70 TWh a year by 2021. That is enough to power a small country by the way. There was a tremendous spike and Vitalik knew the network could not handle it. Another major problem was miners were getting too powerful. A pie chart in the original thread shows that just one pool, Dwarfpool, controlled 47.9% of the hashrate, creating centralization. Ethereum was supposed to be free, not a repeat of the old system.  Vitalik's fix was the Merge. In September 2022, Ethereum swapped its engine mid-flight, moving to PoS. Miners hated it and a lot of people still do. Miners would lose their gigs, but Vitalik pushed through. The Merge did a lot of great things, energy use dropped 99.95%, regular users gained more control and decentralization was saved. Despite the drama with developers and miners raging, Vitalik's bet paid off. Ethereum is still here, proving sometimes the hardest path is the right one.

ethtrader,1l9jvxu,2025-06-12 11:18:46,Is Ethereum's current price a hidden steal or a red flag?,"Ryan Sean Adams, the co-founder of Bankless, a crypto media brand, posted a tweet a couple days ago about Ethereum's journey in a year, from 2024 to 2025. A year ago ETH was near $3,700, and now it is sitting at $2,700. Ryan says it is a 'miracle' you can still snag it under $3,000. In the tweet he pointed to big wins like zero-knowledge rollups boosting scalability, the ETH ETF approval last year, and a seemingly crypto-friendly SEC shift. These things may change Ethereum for the better, rollups cut costs by up to 90% and there will probably be a softer regulatory stance. But is this optimism justified or are we missing the bigger picture??  Are we leaning toward skepticism?? Because while Bitcoin keeps going to new highs, Ethereum's price is lagging a lot. The biggest narrative Bitcoin maxis use against Ethereum is the uncapped supply which is diluting ETH's value. Demand might not keep up with issuance, and that may leave ETH vulnerable. Ryan's points are impressive, but my concern is crypto-wide SEC changes for the worst. Still, I believe Ethereum's dominance is slightly increasing and $2,700 could mean undervaluation from last year, it is a bargain. Investors should study Ethereum, understand it. ETH is a diamond in the rough!! Time will tell if I am right.  *Ryan Adams's tweet: https://x.com/RyanSAdams/status/1932215764737540122*",MasterpieceLoud4931,73,91,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1l9jvxu/is_ethereums_current_price_a_hidden_steal_or_a/,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1l9jvxu/is_ethereums_current_price_a_hidden_steal_or_a/

ethtrader,1ii7i0u,2025-02-05 10:59:15,Not a Lot Realized How Bullish Yesterday US Crypto Czar Meeting Was for Ethereum (ETH),"I think nobody really realized here about what happened yesterday and how bullish this is for Ethereum. I only found [borovik](https://x.com/3orovik/status/1886867221600928054) realizing. As you may know yesterday Crypto Czar David Sacks made a press conference.  You can see it [here](https://x.com/i/broadcasts/1ynJOlELEDvxR).  That press conference goal was to basically talk about crypto, their points of view about it and how they are going to work towards embracing crypto. Yes, you hear it well, US government entirely talking about how embrace crypto and regulate it in a proper way. It feels like it's been 84 years since 2021 when crypto was for criminals and a scam right?  One of the things that got my attention is that they named a lot about stablecoins and this is what made me more bullish on Ethereum and its ecosystem. As you may know USDC and USDT are built on the Ethereum network and if stablecoins become the dominant form of digital dollars this will benefit Ethereum a lot. This will increase demand for the network to handle stablecoins transactions, generate gas fees that are paid in ETH, meaning more demand of ETH. This will make Ethereum a settlement layer making it global and a standard reinforcing it. Also more institutional adoption and more deflationary pressure due to the burns. All of this somehow aligns with my believe that WLF knows something that we don't know.  You are not bullish enough on Ethereum.

A few hours ago Etherealize posted on Twitter their written testimony for the hearing. Etherealize basically called Ethereum the gold standard for decentralized smart contract platforms. They say that Ethereum has been around for 10 years with no single entity controlling it, making it highly secure and resilient, unlike centralized systems that can crash if one part fails. They also say regulatory clarity, like the new CLARITY Act, could bring 100x more users, assets, and apps to the space by clearing up the messy oversight between agencies like the SEC and CFTC.  Decentralization should not be just a fancy word, it should be about real security and uptime, which Ethereum has absolutely. Etherealize's full statement goes even deeper, mentioning how Ethereum's tech like Distributed Validator Technology increases validator security and network resilience. They are set to give oral testimony today, and I am pumped to see how it goes!! This could be a turning point for crypto in the United States. Let's go!!

We can also see that price action  has been rejected from around $3900 area and now decisively broken the ascending trendline support suggesting a possible bearish scenario.  **Indicators :**  1. **MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence):** It is going further into negative territory crossing below the signal line. This bearish crossover shows the increasing downside momentum and selling pressure intensifying. 2. **Stochastic RSI:** Currently at oversold territory with both lines turning flat near the bottom. This can suggest a short term bounce is possible but the lack of upward curvature or bullish crossover indicates that downside exhaustion has not completed yet. 3. **Volume:** It noticeable declined while the formation was formed, this is classic feature of triangles. A surge on volume will confirm us what direction ETH will go.  This can really change in a matter of hours but I believe we will have a bearish continuation to have a healthy correction to $3000 for then have a bullish recovery on September 2025.  **What do you think will happen next?**  *Disclaimer:*  *The concept and ideas in this post come from my own thoughts and everything I have seen online during my three years in crypto.

For many and maybe all crypto investors this will be a celebration day because we all probably believe that he really made a terrible job ""protecting"" US citizens and ""adopting"" crypto. This will be a big relief and it is going to bring a brighter future because the ""pro"" crypto government in US.  [Gary Gensler Crying](https://preview.redd.it/belqvr931zae1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=a56b2bf3bc10de0cc148314cadcb716d55222b32)  Gary Gensler leaving is very important for crypto because SEC acted very hard on it. You will probably still remember things like ""ETH is a security"" narrative, a lot of lawsuit against crypto companies, enforcement actions, unclear rules, etc. everything under the ""protecting citizens"" flag. Funny thing, all the FTX drama happened in front of their nose and failed again to protect citizens.  All this movements only slowed down crypto and forced many projects to move to other countries because they were scared of regulations. Even Coinbase were facing troubles.  But now, the light is coming and Gary Gensler is leaving and there is room for change. Probably the new chairman will be more open minded for crypto and embrace it in a more positive way instead of being a pain in the ass and fight innovation and the future.  This is really bullish because as you may know US is one of the countries that (for good or bad) moves the economy forward or backwards sometimes. Meaning that a pro crypto policies in US will make an statement to other countries which will probably start a race to adopt crypto ASAP to not be the last one.  This will drive more new projects, more adoption, more everything and I am not only talking about BTC treasuries, I am also talking about Ethereum ecosystem expansion in levels that we probably are not capable to imagine.

And this is probably the reason. However, not everything are bad news. Ethereum keeps breaking new records.  Ethereum transactions in its ecosystem keep going parabolic. As you can see in the image above and like the tweet summarizes:  * **Daily TPS (transactions per second):** It has skyrocketed to **325.90**, a huge milestone that shows how much real economic activity is happening on Ethereum ecosystem.  * This is an insane **94.08%+ of that activity** that is currently taking place on **Layer 2 solutions** like Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, zkSync, etc. * As you can see, Ethereum **scaling stack** is processing more transactions than ever, transforming the network into the ultimate **global settlement layer** for the next generation of the internet.  Investing in crypto is not about the price anymore, it is about technology and how far it can evolve. The price will eventually go up but if you have a shitty tech, eventually, it will hit the roof and go down. This is proof that the Ethereum roadmap is working as expected. More users, more apps and more liquidity are moving to L2s and they are all settling back on Ethereum mainnet for security and finality.  This ""bad"" price moves are just to take advantage off because Ethereum technology is not going anywhere and I would only be worried if the price action is related to something specific to Ethereum ecosystem not to just random macroeconomic event or market manipulation. Ethereum is a lot more than that and a good long term investment.  # 🅴🆃🅷🅴🆁🅴🆄🅼 🅸🆂 🆃🅷🅴 🅵🆄🆃🆄🆁🅴  Source:  * Tweet: [https://x.com/LeonWaidmann/status/1971073180442775745](https://x.com/LeonWaidmann/status/1971073180442775745) * Data: [https://www.growthepie.com/](https://www.growthepie.com/)",kirtash93,131,43,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1npz493/market_might_look_ugly_today_but_wake_me_up_when/,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1npz493/market_might_look_ugly_today_but_wake_me_up_when/

ethtrader,1m5dw26,2025-07-21 09:00:17,Why ETH might never be this cheap again,"ETH around these levels (~$3K–$3.5K) might be the last major accumulation zone we see before the next macro cycle shift. Here’s why I’m treating this range as a long-term floor.  First, Ethereum is no longer just a speculative asset. It’s the base layer for real activity — stablecoins, rollups, RWAs, and even ETFs. The network is settling trillions annually, and it’s doing that while burning supply. The merge flipped ETH’s supply dynamics permanently. Every time the network heats up, ETH becomes deflationary. That’s not just hype — it’s visible on-chain.  Second, institutional momentum is building. BlackRock’s ETH ETF isn’t a rumor anymore. It’s coming. The moment ETH becomes accessible through brokerage apps and retirement accounts, capital inflow pressure will ramp up quickly. That’s a shift in access, and once it happens, price tends to catch up fast.  Third, ETH’s L2 ecosystem is finally mature. DeFi is growing again. NFTs are stabilizing. New narratives like restaking and modular chains all flow back to Ethereum’s settlement layer. ETH isn’t just riding trends — it’s structurally tied to most of them.  Cycles don’t wait. By the time retail is confident enough to enter, ETH is usually already up 2x. If history repeats, buying ETH at $3K might look like buying it at $200 in early 2020.  Just because it feels quiet now doesn’t mean it’s dead. It usually means smart money is getting in before the next leg.  This is probably the last “cheap ETH” window we’ll get for a while.",kingkongbananakong,403,227,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1m5dw26/why_eth_might_never_be_this_cheap_again/,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1m5dw26/why_eth_might_never_be_this_cheap_again/

ethtrader,1irjk3u,2025-02-17 13:14:39,Someone burned 500 eth with a mysterious message. Brain-computer weapons?,"Ethereum's censorship resistance was on full display today, as someone sent 500 eth (around $1.38M right now) to the burn address, destroying the coins forever. But more interesting than the act itself was the weird message attached to the transaction.  The message (translated) is:  >The CEOs of Kuande Investment: Feng Xin and Xu Yuzhi used brain-computer weapons to persecute all company employees and former employees, and even they themselves were controlled.  ---  This wasn't the first message from this address. Two other messages were sent in Ethereum transactions within a week.  * **7 days ago:**  >There is a new mode of crime in which the victim is gradually deprived of his senses of desire until he becomes a complete slave to the digital machine, and if one day I become a victim of the final stage, I will leave the world  * **2 days ago:**  >As the brain-computer interface and mind-reading technology keeps developing, there is a new mode of crime in which wild animals become puppets or complete slaves to the digital machine.  ---  I looked up, and ""brain-computer weapons"" would seem to suggest a conspiracy theory about brain-computer interfaces, a technology that connects the human brain directly to computers.  BCIs are being developed by companies like Neuralink (founded by Elon Musk) to help people with disabilities regain motor functions. Some people say that such interfaces could be used for mind control or other forms of coercion.  There's no evidence to support these claims, but the fact that someone burned 500 eth in order to post this message says a lot. They clearly felt it was the only way to give us a warning, using Ethereum's powerful uncensorable system.  ---  This same exact address also sent a ton of eth to donation addresses as well:  1. [591 eth to WikiLeaks donation wallet](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xd5de70368d9f11005b94806ee9d70c31f66b34710fd0de1851a8308a977a0a36) 2. [700 eth to what seems to be a Ukraine donation address](https://etherscan.io/address/ndao.eth)  ---  It's not clear if this person is just a wealthy activist, or a conspiracy theorist, or someone with more weird, evil intentions. What's clear is they're willing to burn millions of dollars to get their messages out.  One of the fundamental principles of Ethereum is that anything written on-chain can never be deleted. This person used Ethereum's blockchain as their own personal permanent message board, proving that in a decentralized system words can't be censored, even if it's extremely expensive.

ethtrader,1mrx3ww,2025-08-16 14:39:02,Why ETH Will Outrun BTC (And Why It’s Already Worth $25k),"Alright fam, let’s talk real for a sec. Everyone and their grandma knows about Bitcoin—the OG crypto, the “digital gold,” the coin your uncle brings up at Christmas right before he tells you he “almost bought some in 2012.” Cool story, Bob.  But here’s the thing: BTC is basically a flex piece at this point. You hold it, you watch number go up (or down lol), and that’s it. It doesn’t do anything. It’s like the Pokémon card in your binder—rare, valuable, but you’re not playing a match with it.  Ethereum tho? Whole different vibe.   1. Utility > Hype  BTC = a vault. ETH = an engine. On ETH, you can:  Run DeFi (aka banking without the bank)  Buy/Sell NFTs (yeah, laugh if you want, but they literally redefined digital ownership)  Spin up DAOs (internet-native co-ops, basically communities with a shared wallet)  Build smart contracts (apps that never sleep, never rug you if coded right)   That’s like comparing a Nokia brick phone to an iPhone. One makes calls, the other runs your whole life.   2. ETH Is the Internet’s Native Currency  Think about it: ETH isn’t just a coin, it’s the fuel for the most used decentralized network in the world. Every major Web3 app? Built on Ethereum or forks of it. If the internet had an in-game currency, it wouldn’t be BTC, it would be ETH.    3. Institutions Are Loading ETH Bags  Here’s the real difference this bull run: Retail doesn’t even matter that much anymore. You don’t need TikTok teens or Elon tweets to pump ETH. Institutions are buying like absolute maniacs. Hedge funds, ETFs, banks—they’re scooping ETH like it’s the last PS5 on Black Friday.  Demand isn’t just hype-driven, it’s structural. They need ETH to build, to stake, to run products for their own clients. It’s literally getting absorbed by the financial system itself.  BTC is still waiting on “muh retail frenzy.” ETH is getting swallowed by Wall Street in real time.    4. Real Value ≠ Current Price  BTC’s price is inflated by brand recognition. ETH’s price is deflated because people still treat it like “that other coin.” But when you factor in what it actually powers + the institutional demand, ETH at $1.8k (or wherever it is rn) is literally clown world.  Real worth? $25,000 easy. Because ETH isn’t just digital oil anymore—it’s becoming the default settlement layer for the global economy.    5. ETH 2.0 = Game Over  Staking = passive income, network secured. Scalability upgrades = faster, cheaper. Ecosystem = growing non-stop.  Meanwhile BTC is just… chilling. No shade, but it’s like your dad refusing to download TikTok.    TLDR:  BTC = shiny rock you flex on Twitter.  ETH = digital oil, internet money, programmable money.  Institutions are buying ETH like hell, retail isn’t even required this cycle.  Real ETH value = $25k+ because it actually powers something.   Not financial advice but… if BTC is Myspace, ETH is TikTok. One’s stuck in the past, the other is running the future.

ethtrader,1mp3a4q,2025-08-13 12:37:31,Guess what: ETH supply is getting squeezed.,"Here is a fun fact: ETH's supply crunch is accelerating and this is not getting enough attention. According to Etheraider on Twitter, ETH treasury strategies are on track to buy more than a decade's worth of ETH issuance in under a year only. Let's look at the numbers!! In the last 4 years Ethereum issued about 3.76 million ETH. In just the past 4 months Strategic ETH Reserve (SER) acquisitions have already reached 3.57 million ETH. If things keep going like this SER alone will get the equivalent of 11.39 years of new ETH supply in its first 12 months. This is not hopium or bullish sentiment, it is data and this data points to a structural shift. ETH's supply is already limited with staking and burning removing ETH from circulation. Now large-scale treasury strategies are taking over supply at a speed the network's issuance cannot match.  Etheraider's takeaway is: there is not enough ETH. Demand keeps rising in this bull phase and the market won't just be competing over new issuance, it will be fighting over what is already locked away. That kind of imbalance does not resolve quietly and we will see it in the price. If you have been waiting for a signal of scarcity then this is it. The clock on ETH's available supply is ticking down, well actually it is being fast-forwarded.  *Source: https://x.com/etheraider/status/1955469147573260428*",MasterpieceLoud4931,352,130,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1mp3a4q/guess_what_eth_supply_is_getting_squeezed/,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1mp3a4q/guess_what_eth_supply_is_getting_squeezed/

ethtrader,1kxdgdk,2025-05-28 10:15:18,Is ETH ready to skyrocket to $10k?,"I found a thread on Twitter posted by 'AltCryptoGems' and at first it seemed like just another hopium post like the others, but there is an element of truth here. They are calling 2025 the year of Ethereum, predicting a massive rally to $10k. Yes, yes.. it sounds crazy, but bear with me, their reasoning makes sense. Ethereum has been kind of a letdown since 2021 even with Bitcoin going to $100k and ETH ETFs getting approved. Network activity has been lower than usual, partly because of competition from other L1s and Sui and even L2s have made gas fees so cheap that ETH burns are not happening much.  In addition to this Bitcoin's dominance has been very high, leaving ETH struggling to hit a new ATH. But that is changing this year, everything is changing. BlackRock has been meeting with the SEC about ETH staking and tokenization, and Ethereum dominates with around 60% of RWA total value locked. We had the Pectra upgrade recently which was huge and great for the price, and Vitalik is planning more upgrades to make Ethereum the biggest global settlement layer. As for stablecoins, Ethereum is handling over $122 billion in stablecoin supply, more than Visa last year. The US is working on the GENIUS Act, which will be great for stablecoin growth. So Ethereum is poised to win.  We should be very optimistic. If these catalysts hit, Ethereum could give us a massive altcoin rally.

He compares it to Bitcoin's boom in 2017, where retail hype turned into institutional inflows. I cannot help but wonder if he is onto something..  There has been a lot of hype around ETH lately, for example like Larry Fink from BlackRock hinting at on-chain securities and talks about national crypto reserves in different countries, mainly the US (already happening). It is crazy to think the 'degens' might be out of the game, sidelined by misinformation. I read somewhere that retail interest dropped 30% last year because of these psyops, leaving the door open for rich people with deep pockets who do not care about old Twitter beefs.  To be completely honest ETH's price has been boring lately, but its fundamentals are still strong, never forget that. If institutions really put trillions in, then $10k could happen. I am both skeptical and excited, maybe it is time to keep an eye on this sleeping titan guys.

Donald Trump’s World Liberty Financial just bought another 3,350 ETH today, worth $110.6M. And they’re still buying.. literally by the minute. By the time this gets posted the total ETH bought today might be even higher. They’re accumulating during the dip, and they wouldn’t be constantly stacking up ETH in big amounts if they didn’t have big plans, or weren’t bullish on it.  In case you're curious, right now World Liberty Financial holds:  * 59,432 ETH * 646,715 WBTC (on Ethereum) * 19,408 STETH (staked on Lido) * 256,315 LINK * 19,399 AAVE * 5.78M ENA * Over $47.52M in stablecoins * And more...  Their total crypto holdings are over $391.3M, and the fact that they have millions in stablecoins is a signal they’re ready to buy even more. Meanwhile, shrimps on the internet are panic selling ETH for cheap, and WLFi is happily buying what they sell. Corporations don’t buy in bulk like this without a plan, something big is coming and they probably know something we don’t.  Luckily we can use blockchain transparency to our advantage. We can watch their wallets and corporative/whale wallets and track their movements. If we want to understand what’s actually happening in the market, we have to follow the money.

ethtrader,1nbzol9,2025-09-08 20:58:25,why eth can't break $4.5k - the buyers just aren't showing up,"been watching this $4.5k resistance for over 10 days now and it's getting frustrating. here's what's actually keeping eth pinned down according to the data.  spot volume delta is showing negative net buying even while we're consolidating. that's not normal - usually consolidation comes with some underlying buying pressure. without real demand, any breakout attempt is going to get slapped back down immediately.  eth etfs are bleeding hard too. last week alone saw $787.6 million in outflows, with friday hitting $446.8 million by itself. when the easiest way to buy eth (etfs) is seeing mass exits, that's a problem for price momentum.  futures open interest dropped 18% from the $70b all-time high on aug 23 down to $58b now. less leverage means less firepower for big moves up or down. remember when we saw similar 18% oi drops in july? eth fell 15% right after.  the network fundamentals aren't helping either. revenue dropped 44% in august even as we hit new aths. transaction fees down 10% over 30 days to $43.3m. the dencun upgrade made l2s cheaper but it's gutting eth's fee burn mechanism.  technically we're forming a descending triangle with support at $4.2k. if that breaks, the pattern targets $3,550 which is an 18% drop. some traders like ted pillows think we might see $3.8k-$3.9k first before any real bounce.  the disconnect is real - addresses growing to 150m but actual network usage and revenue declining. adoption metrics look good but the money flow tells a different story.  anyone else thinking this consolidation turns into a deeper correction before we see $5k?",dumble_hold_the_door,86,134,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1nbzol9/why_eth_cant_break_45k_the_buyers_just_arent/,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1nbzol9/why_eth_cant_break_45k_the_buyers_just_arent/
ethtrader,1mj27zx,2025-08-06 11:36:00,ETH is still misunderstood. Sassal.eth says the price will wake people up.,"A lot of people, even those involved in the crypto space, do not understand Ethereum or ETH. You see it all the time, people think Ethereum is just another Bitcoin knockoff. But it is not, Ethereum is far more powerful than Bitcoin and ETH is the currency that fuels its system. Yet many people miss this. Ethereum community member known on Twitter as sassal.eth, said that 'you will only get it when ETH hits $100,000 or more.'  Right now ETH is sitting at around $3,600. Analysts like Tom Lee predict it could rally a lot thanks to institutional interest. ETH is the second largest crypto by market cap and Ethereum hosts almost 300,000 tokens. Yet there is still a lot of confusion, people focus on Bitcoin's value store label and do not know Ethereum's utility and that is a problem.  So as sassal.eth said the price spike will shock people into learning. When ETH gets its deserved rally the world will see its real power. Until then you are stuck guessing. There is a lot of hype for the future, many people really believe ETH could go to $100,000.. fair enough. The truth is Ethereum's potential stays hidden until the market forces you to pay attention.  *Source: https://x.com/sassal0x/status/1952852548978868542*",MasterpieceLoud4931,161,121,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1mj27zx/eth_is_still_misunderstood_sassaleth_says_the/,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1mj27zx/eth_is_still_misunderstood_sassaleth_says_the/

ethtrader,1mna1mi,2025-08-11 11:09:19,ETH is ready for price discovery and to outpace BTC again.,"Getting straight to the point: ETH is setting up for its biggest run yet. A tweet posted by Etheraider points out something simple but huge, ETH still has not reclaimed its ATH of $4.8k. When it does there is no resistance left, so that is when price discovery starts happening and $6,500/$7,000 becomes the next stop. The timing matters of course. The Federal Reserve is expected to cut rates in the next month. Historically that is when money goes back into risk assets. In previous cycles ETH has consistently outperformed Bitcoin during these risky phases, gaining 20/30% over BTC. This is not hopium or a guess or anything, it has happened before, look it up.   ETH today is also very different from what it was in the last bull run. It is more regulated, the supply is shrinking because of staking and burning and the tech is better than ever. ETH has it all, strong fundamentals, favorable macro conditions and a record of outpacing BTC when the market rallies. If we break $4.8k the conversation changes, $10k could be the top. The market is quiet right now.. but silence does not last forever. For ETH this is the calm before its biggest storm yet.  *Source: https://x.com/etheraider/status/1954550520808661068*",MasterpieceLoud4931,276,77,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1mna1mi/eth_is_ready_for_price_discovery_and_to_outpace/,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1mna1mi/eth_is_ready_for_price_discovery_and_to_outpace/

It looks like that backfired :D.  You can start to see the panic on social media, traders who made fun of ETH now chase it. Some held strong and collected the rewards, others are now kicking themselves. At this stage we see predictions everywhere, maybe even hitting a new ATH. US moves like yesterday's 401(k) alternative asset order will fuel this rally!!  Mark my words this will be the most hated rally ever. That is because it exposes the doubters. They sold low, missed the pump and now watch ETH climb. The silence from Ethereum haters turned to desperation. Hold or buy back, it is your call.

A lot of them said it would never hit $3,000 again.. they were wrong. Ignore them, their takes are just noise, driven by clicks and even rage bait, not facts. The real story is very different.  Like I always say: follow the money. Right now institutional money is behind ETH's rise. There are even predictions that the price could reach $10k by next year. This is possible, why? Because adoption is growing very fast, as a matter of fact faster than ever!! Look how much ETH is being talked about in the mainstream media this year alone. Finance leans on Ethereum for DeFi. The world needs Ethereum!! Look at the records that protocols like Uniswap, Aave, etc break time and time again, this means there is real demand. Industries like healthcare, gaming, supply chain are embracing Ethereum.  The point is big players, not loudmouths, move the market. These influencers mislead you, they do not understand the data. Traders look for trends, not fundamentals. Institutions do not care about trends or hype, they invest billions. You do not need to listen to the crypto meme lords, watch where the money is going. Ethereum keeps proving its worth daily. The recent price pump reflects adoption, not hype. So again, trust the numbers not the noise. And when the next bearish post shows up just scroll past it.

I know this is a sub for eth so you guys are obviously biased but do you see ETH as a long term investment or a short term play? Just looking for what you guys honestly think. I feel like ETH is kinda destined to hit like 6k and then drop afterwards. If you compare to 2021 cycle it's basically even, which makes me question ETH long term. (Unless you think that ETH cycle has really started yet)   My thoughts is that I think the blockchain is important however there is just so much competition between different cryptos and now institutions creating their own. And if institutions are just going to create there own blockchains off a fork of ETH, why is ETH important? Wouldn't you be better off with a blockchain ETF like BLOK? What makes ETH better than everyone else? What makes you think that ETH is going to survive?  Or if your a short term investor, do you plan on just selling soon and buying again during the bear market in a few years. Thanks!  And just for fun are you guys are you guys only in ETH?

Quantitative Easing Is Coming Q4 2025:**  * The Fed is wrapping up its Quantitative Tightening phase (they're reducing Treasury holdings right now, check the Fed site). That means more money printer go brrrr by Q4. * This shift favors risk on assets, and crypto is the king of risk. The last time this happened (early 2021), TOTAL3, the altcoin market cap minus BTC/ETH exploded. This is textbook macro setup for altcoins to rip.  **🟠 2. Bitcoin Already Blew Its Load:**  * BTC just hit new all time highs and has been dominating for 3 years straight. But BTC dominance (BTC.D) is now stalling at its historical peak .. just like in 2017 and 2021… right before altcoins went parabolic.  * With QE incoming, we’re likely to see capital rotation out of BTC and into altcoins. And where does that money go first? ETH. Always ETH.  **🟣 3. Ethereum Is Severely Undervalued:**  * BTC hit ATH. ETH didn’t. Yet. ETH is like the dude who didn’t go to the party, but just found out the keg is full and the cops aren't coming. * Combine that with easing macro and a setup for liquidity to rotate down the risk curve, ETH is perfectly positioned to lead the charge.    **🔥 TL;DR:**  **🤑 Money printer is about to turn on**  **📉 BTC dominance is topping**  **💎 ETH looking juicy AF**    We’re not in alt season yet.

In that tweet, Pentoshi talked about how public companies might soon buy enough ETH to offset all new coins created since the Merge. That is a game-changer especially since the Merge made Ethereum a lot better and accessible and made ETH a better choice for investing.  Right now ETH's market cap is just 1/9th of BTC, Pentoshi says a flood of capital could send it to the moon. He is telling us to stop tribalism and watch the trend unfold, more specifically to follow Fundstrat's steps. As I always say: follow the money. Corporate interest is growing, data confirms that it is.. but is this hype or reality?? Pentoshi said 'set your bias aside' which makes sense because too many of us are stuck on Bitcoin's throne.   In the tweet I mentioned there was someone making a counterpoint saying the old glory days of Ethereum (ICO etc) are over, and that stablecoins are Ethereum's only hope.

ethtrader,1mk51b1,2025-08-07 16:39:41,eth just stole solana's lunch money and now we're targeting 4k,"so apparently while we were all watching the charts, eth has been quietly becoming the smart money's favorite child. glassnode just dropped some juicy data showing that capital is rotating from sol back to eth in a big way.  the sol/eth hot capital ratio just tanked 42% since april and hit yearly lows. basically means the quick money traders are dumping their solana bags and loading up on eth instead. not gonna lie, feels pretty good watching this happen after months of sol maxis telling us their chain was the future.  what's really getting me hyped is the open interest numbers. eth futures just hit $58 billion - that's an all time high. meanwhile eth's share of total oi across exchanges jumped to 34.8% while btc dropped from 59% to 47%. the big money is clearly flowing our way.  but here's the kicker - funding rates are still super chill compared to when we tried to break 4k back in march and december. funding rates literally cut in half since march, which means this isn't just degens longing with 100x leverage. this looks like actual spot buying from treasury companies and etfs.  some analyst on twitter said treasury companies and spot etfs have each bought around 1.6% of total eth supply since june. that's insane institutional demand right there. eth/btc pair is also looking spicy - first time above the 200 day ema in over two years. while btc is getting rejected hard at 116k, we're sitting pretty and eyeing that 4k resistance.   yeah we pulled back almost 10% this week but bounced right back to 3800. honestly this correction feels healthy compared to the usual eth volatility we're used to.  one crypto analyst said once we break 4k, we probably won't see sub-4k again anytime soon. price discovery mode after that. with all this rotation happening, hope you guys are keeping track of your trades properly. been using awaken.tax to manage all the chaos from swapping between chains and tracking my eth positions. definitely don't want to get caught off guard when tax season rolls around with all these gains we're about to make. ngl this setup is looking pretty bullish. what do you guys think? are we finally ready to send it past 4k this time or is this just another fakeout?

ethtrader,1n2cojd,2025-08-28 13:46:51,1 Million ETH Just Hit the Exit Door – Should We Be Worried,"So there’s a pretty wild stat floating around: more than 1M ETH (≈$5B) is sitting in the exit queue right now. Biggest validator exodus we’ve ever seen. Wait time to unstake? Over 18 days.  At first glance it feels bearish. Big exits, long queues — easy to think “oh no, everyone’s bailing.” But zoom out a bit: ETH is up ~72% in the last 3 months. If you were running validators, locking in some gains after that kind of pump isn’t exactly crazy. Profit-taking happens.  What’s interesting is the market doesn’t seem spooked. RedStone’s co-founder even called it “healthy market dynamics.” Meanwhile, institutional flow into ETH is still strong:  $33B open interest in ETH futures right now.  Standard Chartered still has their $7.5k ETH by year-end call.  Polymarket gives ETH a 26% shot at $5k this month.  And even though exits > entries (737k ETH waiting to stake vs 1M+ waiting to unstake), the network is still solid with over 1M active validators.  To me, this looks more like people cashing chips after a run, not losing faith in ETH. Institutions seem happy to scoop what retail/stakers unload.  So… what’s the play? Buying this dip, waiting it out, or do you think this exit flood actually drags ETH lower?

ethtrader,1nqxl2h,2025-09-26 10:16:53,"Whales accumulate while retail panics, same old story for ETH.","ETH's recent drop to (now below) $4k has been declared as the standard narrative of bearish opinions on social media. If this looks familiar it is because those same voices were also vocal when ETH hit its low of the year at around $1,380, this was not too long ago. At that point back then they were calling for a collapse. So what happened?? Instead, the price tripled.  Our good old friend DCinvestor pointed out the obvious on Twitter: it is easier to trust in the people who are buying hundreds of millions of dollars worth of ETH every week than those who have already been proved wrong. As always on-chain data confirms this. Whales bought more than 210,000 ETH last week alone as retail investors panicked and sold.. you know just the usual stuff. CEX reserves are at their lowest showing supply is tightening even as article headlines spread fear. Yes the market has been brutal this past week, billions of liquidations, big dips and ETF flows slowing down. But every dip so far has been met with accumulation, not with investors quitting. History shows whales do not chase the hype instead they accumulate when sentiment is at its worst. Shorting ETH has been a losing strategy every cycle and the doomsters who cried at $1,380 are crying again at $3.9k/$4k. Maybe what they should do is to pay attention and observe who is actually buying.  *Source: https://x.com/iamDCinvestor/status/1971122232480104777*",MasterpieceLoud4931,136,66,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1nqxl2h/whales_accumulate_while_retail_panics_same_old/,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1nqxl2h/whales_accumulate_while_retail_panics_same_old/

ethtrader,1mbrk7k,2025-07-28 20:34:14,eth about to smash through $4k after three failed attempts cause this setup looks way too good to ignore,"so i've been watching eth dance around this $4k level since february and honestly, this time feels different. we've seen it get rejected three times already, but the stars are actually aligning now.  the numbers don't lie - eth etfs just pulled in a ridiculous $727 million in a single day, and they've been on a 16-day inflow streak. that's not retail fomo, that's serious institutional money coming in. blackrock alone is sitting on $10.69 billion worth of eth and they're not slowing down.  what really caught my attention is how network activity has exploded. daily transactions jumped 73% to 1.62 million, and we're seeing 670k daily active addresses - that's a 12-month high. the defi tvl is back at $86 billion, which we haven't seen since 2022.  but here's what makes me think we're about to break through: eth supply on exchanges dropped to 15.6 million, the lowest since before the 2017 rally. when supply gets squeezed like this while demand is cranking up, things get spicy fast.  the technicals are screaming too. just broke out of a bull flag pattern with a target of $5k. that's a 30% move from here if it plays out.  companies are loading up their treasuries with eth left and right. bitmine just bought $2 billion worth in 16 days and became the biggest corporate holder. even galaxy's ceo is calling $4k and saying eth will outperform btc over the next six months. with all these potential gains stacking up, definitely worth getting your tax situation sorted early, tools like awaken.tax are clutch for tracking everything when these moves happen fast.  i know we've been burned before, but this feels like the real deal. the combination of institutional flow, corporate adoption, network growth, and supply squeeze is creating the perfect storm.  what do you guys think, are we finally going to see eth blast past $4k or is this just another fakeout?",hodorrny,232,67,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1mbrk7k/eth_about_to_smash_through_4k_after_three_failed/,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1mbrk7k/eth_about_to_smash_through_4k_after_three_failed/

(.03462 means 1 eth is worth 3.46% of 1 BTC. )  In fact this means ETH has wiped all out gains against BTC since April 2021 when ETH was \~2k and BTC was around \~$60k. Since then ETH has completed the merge moving it from POW to POS and Proto-Danksharding (which dropped the gas cost on L2s). Still in comparing it's value against BTC, ETH has officially lost all of it's bear market gains.

CryptoCurrency,1kacnlf,2025-04-29 01:51:17,Ethereum has far and away the most advanced technology in crypto,"For the outsider who is not well-acquainted with the crypto sector, it may not be obvious — given how much marketing hype there is about every blockchain — but Ethereum has far and away the most advanced technology in crypto, and any project outside of Ethereum is at best a long-shot fueled by VC ambitions.  Let's go through tangible metrics:  Ethereum mainnet supports 21.3 TPS, and blob-enabled rollups now push that to 125+ TPS — all while preserving Ethereum’s base-layer security and verifiability. No other protocol scales with this level of trustlessness. Competing chains boost TPS by sacrificing verifiability — offloading consensus or requiring privileged hardware (see chart below).  The idea that high-TPS chains have ""better tech"" for parallel execution is also outdated. MegaETH — a high-performance Ethereum scalability solution — brings true parallelism and high throughput to the EVM, secured by ETH via EigenLayer and EigenDA. On execution, MegaETH now outpaces all so-called high-scalability virtual machines (see below). On data availability, EigenDA already exceeds the capacity of every competing DA solution.  When it comes to DeFi security and tooling, the EVM has always been unmatched — as Aave founder Stani Kulechov points out in an interview with Laura Shin:  https://unchainedcrypto.com/why-the-founders-of-aave-and-sky-are-still-bullish-on-ethereum-defi/  And on client software, Ethereum leads by a wide margin. No other chain comes close to its level of client diversity — a key factor in decentralization and network resilience.  At this point, the EVM and Ethereum stack offer:  • The most secure virtual machine with the strongest developer tooling  • The most decentralized and verifiable network architecture  • The most scalable modular tech stack — across execution, settlement, and data availability — without compromising decentralization  Despite cutting corners everywhere, other chains cannot come close to Ethereum on any metric.",aminok,347,482,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kacnlf,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1kacnlf/ethereum_has_far_and_away_the_most_advanced/
CryptoCurrency,1gu6bhl,2024-11-18 14:45:15,The Ethereum Value Proposition: Dark Horse Edition,"If you’ve been in this sub for years, you may remember a series of posts here dubbed “ethereum value proposition” back in 2021 by yours truly during an epic eth fud campaign before ETH went on its face ripping rally.   Check the receipts, I did a multi week series in mid march 2021 and days later eth made the face melting gains 3x and up.  Why am I telling you this? To toot my own horn? No.   It’s because the reason I made those posts years ago was because the market was being HIGHLY irrational toward ETH and I believe it is doing it again, and where irrationality exists, opportunity for gains exists as well.  If you’ve had a pulse in crypto the last 3-6 months you’ll know everyone and their mom has turned bearish on ETH. In 2021 the criticism was “EtH cAnT ScALe”, now it’s “EtH is DeD”  Nonsense. And here’s why:  Tradfi has quickly realized that the megalithic opportunity in crypto is stablecoins (see https://x.com/nic__carter/status/1857408855719674075).  As you can see stablecoin volume has skyrocketed in the last 4 years eclipsing PayPal, bitcoin, remittances, and ALMOST approaching the levels of VISA, the largest payment processor in the world.  Guess where the VAST majority of stablecoin volume happens? Yep Ethereum and it’s L2s. Over 70%.  “Oh but ETH L1 has no usage no one uses it or oh it’s L2s are dead bla bla bla.”   No, ETH has significantly scaled by introducing “blobs” a few months back. check L2beat, Ethereum and its L2s users and transactions are near all time highs for an aggregate of ~370 TPS currently. Source: https://l2beat.com/scaling/activity  “Oh ok so some people use ETH big deal, but it’s still not a good investment”  If that were true,why then while everyone and their mom has been fudding ETH, Blackrock, (the largest hedge fund in the world)in the last 2 months has increased it’s holdings of ETH in its ETFs by a whopping 65%? Source: https://x.com/EthereanVibin/status/1858254969389863290  Why is over 95% of Blackrocks “BUIDL” fund of over 500 million dollars built on Ethereum?  Why are states like Florida and Michigan starting to acquire ETH? Florida now holds over 800 million in crypto related investments and Michigan 11 million: https://www.ccn.com/news/crypto/michigan-largest-ethereum-etf-holders-us/  “Oh but Bitcoin is the only scarce asset with real value for holders, everything else is just a scam or gambling”  Since proof of stake and the burn was implemented about 3 years ago ETH has had HALF the inflation rate of bitcoin: https://ultrasound.money/  In laymen’s terms, bitcoin is being printed at twice the rate of ETH. People literally do not realize this. This is beyond significant.  Michael Saylor himself, the bitcoin messiah has said that bitcoin HAS to figure out a way to generate yield, because just holding it long term is not economically feasible, direct quote:  “The point is If the capital doesnt generate a return  its a non performing asset, you need to address the issue. If I put $100B into $BTC and the yield is 0%, thats just as bad as having $100B bonds that pay 0% yield. In both cases theyre non performing""  Source: https://x.com/etheraider/status/1836493170772971646  What this means is that Saylor fully recognizes that yield is KING.  Everyone knows that stocks that provide quality yield command a premium, you don’t think crypto assets will command the same premium anon?  But don’t confuse yield with inflation, yield comes from “activity/MEV/fees”, because if you have high yield due to inflation and not from actual usage of the chain, then your yield will be high but so will the inflation of your coin so you never come out ahead.  And what chain has the purest native premium on yield? The one with the most activity/mev/fees RELATIVE to its inflation, in other words Ethereum.  Saylor for a long time discredited eth because he said it was a security. Now it officially is not. He now says he wants a “form of bitcoin” aka a scarce asset that gives him yield…..  You do the math.  Saylor may never capitulate and buy ETH due to pride or maybe because he’s built a religious cult following and attack the fragility of bitcoin maximalism by holding another asset but that doesn’t mean you have to repeat his mistake.  Is ETH the BEST asset in crypto? No, there’s no way I can make that claim about any asset without being biased or disingenuous.  Is it ONE of the best risk adjusted reward plays right now given history, tech, present social bias, and network effect?  Absolutely.   I could go on and on about how ETH has always outperformed BTC in bull cycles, how the weekly RSI is at all time historic lows and therefore represents a legendary buying opp, etc etc  But I’ll end with this:  3 years ago the level of FUD surrounding ETH is what prompted me to post this series because it was so over the top irrational.  The same pattern is repeating now.  If you listened then and did the counter trade congrats. If you didn’t, here’s your second chance  Don’t fall for the CT FUD doomloop.  ETH is the dark horse this cycle.  Load up, you won’t regret it.

Ethereum is not just another crypto, it is the backbone of the decentralized future. It is programmable money, the infrastructure for DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, Layer 2s, Real World Assets (RWAs), stablecoins and a much more.  Furthermore, all the decisions made by Ethereum ecosystem have been made to make Ethereum like it is today and to become what it is going to become. Since the shift to Proof of Stake, ETH is not low energy, yield generating and even deflationary at times with high activity. It is also really usable now with the blobs upgrade that even thought it increased inflation for a while it has drastically reduced gas fees and made Ethereum scalable for when it becomes mainstream and the whole world starts using it, making it again deflationary without no doubt. Holding ETH is like holding a piece of a decentralized Internet.  In the other hand we have Bitcoin, yes, it is the OG and respect to that. It has a fixed supply and no frills, lets call it Digital Gold. However it is ""static"". You can't build apps on it like Ethereum. No smart contracts, no ecosystem of dApps, no yield unless you take extra risk elsewhere.  While Bitcoin is digital gold, Ethereum is digital oil, fueling a whole economy of innovation, experimentation and value creation.  Thousands of devs are building the future of Ethereum, from zk rollups to real world assets and the platform where this happen is Ethereum. Anyway, both are totally different things with totally different purposes so its a good way to ""diversify"".  We as shrimps dont have to pick sides, we just need to take advantage of opportunities to improve our lives and both are a must in a healthy portfolio.

It’s a psychological barrier for traders and a technical resistance level that has stopped ETH multiple times in the past. Break it with volume, and we could see momentum carry ETH toward its previous ATH and maybe beyond. Fail to hold above 4K, and we might witness a sharp correction as over-leveraged positions unwind.  The current setup feels eerily similar to historical pre-breakout phases, where consolidation near a key level led to explosive upside.

It is the original, the brand name, the ""digital gold"" that Wall Street has embraced with massive ETF inflows but there is a quiet shift happening under the surface and it could end up giving Ethereum the upper hand.  As you probably know since their launch Bitcoin ETFs has pulled in more than $56.8 billion while Ethereum ETFs even if they started months later have already attracted around $26.8 billion. On first sight, Bitcoin still looks dominant but when you compare those inflows to the size of each network the story flips. For Bitcoin, that $56.8B equals to just 2.6% of its market cap. However for Ethereum, $26.8B represents 5.3%. In other words, every dollar going into ETH has nearly twice the market impact compared to BTC.  This difference is important because Ethereum is not just a store of value, it is a yield bearing and programmable economy. Investors are not buying ETH for the price, they are also buying access to staking rewards, tokenized assets and a network that keeps evolving with real world apps. Wall Street see this and their growing interest suggest that ETH may be positioned for stronger relative performance.  When this happens, it often marks the early stages of an alt season. Are we close to see a surge on ETH with its proper insane alt season later?

Additionally, with the updated ETH, the network will become faster and cheaper, and even more reliant. No other chain is as reliant as ETH for smart contracts.  If ETH is going to 0, then all other alt coins will go down as well. It is the 3rd most traded coin and 3 times more than 4th place, meaning there is no head-on-head-race going on at all!

Analysts are bullish on ETH's price action, predicting it could reach $20,000 in the coming months, although some experts caution against over-leveraging the asset.

I expect there will be a bit more of a tug of war before the next break out.  In the last 30 days, ETH is +46% while the market leader, BTC, is just +1%.  From 0.025 to 0.036 in the ETH/BTC ratio.  In the last 90 days, ETH is +71% the market leader, BTC, is +11%.  We can see from the graph and stats below, ETH dominance has risen quite nicely compared to the rest of the market.

That’s absolutely insane—how can the fees be almost as much as the transaction itself? ETH gas fees are ridiculous. Why does it cost so much just to send a few lines of code across the network?  It’s hard to justify these kinds of fees for something that’s supposed to make decentralized finance accessible. It feels like the system is designed to benefit only a small group of people while others are stuck paying exorbitant costs. The whole thing is starting to seem more and more like a big Ponzi scheme, where the fees just line the pockets of a few, leaving regular users out in the cold.  For a system that’s supposed to be revolutionary and efficient, it’s doing the opposite for the average person. Why should it be this expensive just to make basic transactions?

Why?","just saw some wild whale activity that has me thinking about what's really driving these moves from btc to eth.  the latest whale move:  a bitcoin og who held for 7 years just sold 670 btc ($76 million) to go long on ethereum. this whale had been sitting on approx 14k btc worth over $1.6 billion since buying from binance and htx way back in the day. instead of just holding cash, they immediately opened 4 long positions totaling approx 68k eth - most of it on 10x leverage around the $4,300 mark. this isn't isolated:  bitmine immersion just added another approx 52k eth to their treasury, bringing total holdings to 1.52 million tokens worth $6.6 billion institutional wallets were buying up approx 9k eth each ($38 million) during recent dips other satoshi-era whales have been moving massive amounts of btc after years of dormancy  why the shift is happening: timing matters: this happened right after btc hit its new ath of $124k and eth almost reclaimed its 2021 high of $4,878. smart money often rotates between assets at these levels.  leverage opportunities: you can't really leverage btc the same way institutional players can leverage eth. these whales are opening massive leveraged positions because they see more upside potential in eth.  institutional infrastructure: ethereum has better institutional tools now. defi protocols, staking yields, and corporate treasury strategies all favor eth over btc for active management.  market maturity: crypto analysts say og bitcoiners selling is actually healthy - it shows new buyers entering and markets maturing. the money isn't leaving crypto, it's rotating.  risk vs reward calculation: when you've made 1000x+ gains on btc, taking some profits to bet on eth's next move up makes sense. especially when eth has more room to grow percentage-wise.  the reality check: not all these moves worked out immediately. the whale's eth positions went underwater after opening, dropping to $4,080 and putting three positions close to liquidation around $3,700.  but that's the point - whales are willing to take these risks because they see eth as having more upside potential than btc at current levels.  what this means:  we're seeing a rotation from ""store of value"" btc plays into ""growth asset"" eth plays. whales who made their fortunes in btc are now betting that eth will be the next big mover. this isn't about btc being bad - it's about opportunity cost. when you're sitting on billions in gains, diversifying into the asset with better risk/reward makes sense. anyone else noticing this pattern of btc profits rotating into eth? feels like we're in the middle of a major capital rotation.

Which Microcaps Are You Watching?","With Ethereum climbing close to new all-time highs and Bitcoin dominance showing some interesting movements, many in the space are already preparing for the long-awaited altcoin season.  Historically, when ETH gains momentum, capital tends to flow into mid-caps and eventually into microcaps. We’re already seeing strong signs of stabilization and consolidation across the market – the kind of setup that often precedes explosive altcoin runs.  I’ve been researching different microcaps in the RWA (real-world asset) sector since that narrative is gaining traction. One example is **REM**, a utility token focused on real estate metaverse integration.

CryptoMarkets,1n0yd9e,2025-08-26 21:24:09,Ethereum Begins to Step Out of Bitcoin’s Shadow,"Over the past few months, the relationship between Bitcoin and Ethereum has started to look different from what the market has grown used to in previous cycles. Historically, Bitcoin has always acted as the anchor, setting the pace for the entire digital asset space. When Bitcoin surged, altcoins followed, and when it corrected, the rest of the market almost always lost steam. This time, however, Ethereum is beginning to show signs that it can sustain its own momentum even when Bitcoin softens.  Bitcoin recently slid to levels not seen in close to two months, giving back gains made during its strong August rally. In earlier years, such a retreat would normally drag the broader market down with it. Yet, instead of fading, Ethereum has gained renewed attention. Traders have been quick to position themselves around Ether, which touched a new record near US$4,955, a level that has shifted sentiment across the market.  One of the clearest indications of this shift comes from institutional flows. Exchange traded funds that track Bitcoin posted heavy outflows in August, with more than US$1 billion leaving those products. At the same time, Ether linked funds moved in the opposite direction, attracting around US$3.3 billion. Such a wide gap points to more than short term trading. It reflects a deliberate change in investor preference, where capital is beginning to migrate toward Ethereum as a primary holding rather than a secondary one.  The story, however, is not entirely one sided. Developments within the Bitcoin ecosystem are also drawing attention. The upcoming rollout of Bitlayer V2, which integrates Bitcoin native rollups, is expected to follow listings on large centralized exchanges such as Bitget. Alongside that, the introduction of BitVM, a model allowing EVM style smart contracts to function on the Bitcoin network, could create new ways for liquidity to remain within Bitcoin’s DeFi framework. These upgrades may help Bitcoin defend its long standing dominance.  Even so, what makes this market moment unique is the fact that Ethereum is finally being recognized as more than just a secondary option. Several growth drivers are working in its favor at once. Consistent inflows into Ether ETFs, rising demand for staking as a yield generating mechanism, and the rapid expansion of tokenized real world assets on its network are all contributing to its strength. Taken together, these factors suggest that Ethereum’s trajectory no longer needs to mirror Bitcoin’s in lockstep. Instead, it is starting to attract independent flows of capital, carving out a leadership role in its own right for the first time.",SuccessOdd382,72,53,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1n0yd9e/ethereum_begins_to_step_out_of_bitcoins_shadow/,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1n0yd9e/ethereum_begins_to_step_out_of_bitcoins_shadow/

It seems like for the first time in a while, two of the biggest players are heading in completely opposite directions.  A. Bitcoin's Institutional Ascent: A New Digital Gold  The cryptocurrency market is showing a clear split in how big money is being allocated. Bitcoin is cementing its position as a ""digital gold,"" and the numbers are backing it up.  1. US spot Bitcoin ETFs just saw nearly $2.9 billion in inflows over a seven-day streak.  2. The total holdings of these ETFs are now a record 1.32 million BTC, accounting for 6.6% of Bitcoin's total market cap.  3. This institutional demand is outpacing new supply from mining by nearly nine times, creating serious upward pressure on the price.   B. Ethereum's Quiet Maturation and Institutional Outflows  Ethereum's story is a bit different. The network just went through a major technical upgrade (Pectra) that's supposed to make it more efficient and scalable. But institutional investors seem to be looking right past that.  1. As Bitcoin was seeing massive inflows, Ethereum ETFs experienced significant outflows, totaling over $341 million in a single week.  It seems like for many large investors, fundamental network improvements are secondary to the narrative and liquidity. They're seeing Bitcoin as a store of value, and that's all that seems to matter to them right now.  What's everyone's take on this? Is this a sign that for big money, Bitcoin's ""digital gold"" narrative is all that matters, or is there a bigger long-term play for Ethereum that institutional players aren't seeing yet?  P.S.

Put together, ETFs and treasuries alone represent more than $32B of ETH essentially removed from circulation. And unlike traders, these institutions are not looking to sell. Their mandate is accumulation and long term holding.  Add in staked ETH, DeFi collateral locks, and long term holders, and the amount of truly liquid ETH available for trading keeps shrinking. Standard Chartered’s head of digital assets recently said: “Treasury companies are a massive buyer. They will not sell. The impact will stay.”  The tax implications of this institutional shift are becoming clearer too. Many retail holders are using platforms like awaken.tax to properly track their ETH transactions as they decide whether to hold through what could be a major supply crunch or take profits along the way. The institutional buying pressure is forcing individual investors to think more strategically about their positions.  This is the same playbook we watched unfold with Bitcoin.

While most people are chasing meme rotations or just watching Bitcoin stay flat, ETH spot ETFs have now recorded 16 straight days of inflows. Just on Friday alone, they pulled in 453 million dollars. And that is not random. Someone is clearly building a position.  It’s not even evenly spread. BlackRock’s ETHA brought in 440 million dollars on its own that day. One fund. That’s not just a good day. That’s serious intent. ETHA now holds over 10.69 billion dollars. And that’s not some casual exposure either. its a major position.    After that Bitwise and Fidelity followed with inflows of around 10 million and 7 million while Grayscale’s ETHE is still bleeding though. It lost another 23 million on Friday. But even with that kind of outflow the overall flow across ETH ETFs stayed green. These says a lot. Quiet demand is still stronger than legacy outflows.   it becomes clearer to me. Since launch ETH spot ETFs have now taken in 9.33 billion dollars in total inflows. Their combined assets under management are now sitting at 20.66 billion dollars which is already about 4.6% of ETH’s total market cap. just on Thursday over 1.5 billion dollars in value was traded across these ETFs. So it’s not just inflows, real volume is also picking up.  Here’s how I see it. It reminds me of how the BTC ETF flows started earlier this year. Just steady accumulation while everyone was distracted. ETH hasn’t had much hype lately or any new major narrative and aggressive push. And maybe that’s exactly why institutions are loading up now. The price is still reasonable with a consistent flow. but most retail traders aren’t even looking. it is still sitting quietly around 3700 dollars as if none of this is happening. But when i see flows like this building behind the scenes without price moving yet, it usually means one of two things. Either the interest fades away or the price catches up fast. And from what I’m seeing here this feels like the second one.",SuccessOdd382,71,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1m9z73p/ethereum_etfs_now_hold_46_of_market_cap_with/,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1m9z73p/ethereum_etfs_now_hold_46_of_market_cap_with/

Then Galaxy Digital immediately sold 10,000 BTC, sending Bitcoin tumbling down  Novogratz isn't abandoning Bitcoin  he still predicts $150,000 and Galaxy holds 13,504 BTC. But they're clearly making a calculated rotation into Ethereum, now holding 64,858 ETH as their second-largest position.   While Bitcoin companies issue convertible debt to fund their BTC purchases, Ethereum treasury companies are using equity financing instead. That's a fundamentally different risk profile no leverage, no debt obligations if things go sideways.  Companies like BitMine Immersion with 566,766 ETH and Sharplink Gaming with 360,807 ETH are betting big on this model. Ether Machine is even going public on NASDAQ with $1.5 billion committed to Ethereum.  The numbers back up the sentiment too. Ethereum ETFs pulled in $2.4 billion in six days during July while Bitcoin ETFs managed $827 million. BlackRock's ETHA is now managing over $10 billion, which suggests institutional appetite for ETH exposure is accelerating.  What I find compelling is the yield component. Bitcoin treasury companies basically just hold and hope for price appreciation. Ethereum treasury companies can stake, participate in DeFi, generate actual returns on their holdings while maintaining upside exposure. That's a different value proposition entirely.  They're positioning for a trend where corporate treasuries don't just store value  they actively generate yield.

Can someone sanity-check if I’m reading this right?  **BMNR = Secular Bet on Ethereum’s Institutional Future**  * **Ethereum as Infra** → ETH is digital oil powering programmable finance. * **Institutional Adoption** → BMNR gives Wall St + retail a *stock ticker gateway* into Ethereum, with treasury leverage layered on top. * **Stablecoin/Tokenization Boom** → With the GENIUS Act and regulatory clarity, BMNR sees ETH as the dominant L1 for tokenized assets and financial rails. * **AI Integration** → ETH as the back-end for AI agents. BMNR wants to own/stake ETH to secure the rails that AI will eventually run on. * **5% Network Goal** → Long-term target = own 5% of ETH’s network through holdings + ecosystem participation. * **Treasury Strategy** → Think MicroStrategy, but for ETH. Instead of just stacking coins, BMNR adds upside by being plugged into infra and tokenization plays.  Now this is shockingly obvious, and one can only think that it is wrong but it is impossible to avoid the **MicroStrategy analogue**:  $BTC rose 11x in 2020–2021  $MSTR rose 30x, thanks to the market premium on its treasury strategy + conviction  **BMNR is already showing similar leverage:**  $ETH rose 1.5x (Jun → Jul 2025)  $BMNR rose 9.5x over the same period — a 6x multiplier on ETH gains.  I would be happy if BMNR 3x ETH's gains. Do you think the market keeps rewarding BMNR with that multiplier… or does this kind of premium always mean-revert? So… is this a fair take?

According to the company’s CEO, Rick Wurster, both BTC and ETH will become meaningful long-term growth drivers for the company.  Wurster initially revealed Schwab’s plans to start spot crypto trading last November and reiterated the plans in the firm’s Spring 2025 Business Update. At the time, he said that the deployment would depend on a better regulatory environment in the US.  “Our expectation is that with the changing regulatory environment, we are hopeful and likely to be able to launch direct spot crypto and our goal is to do that in the next 12 months and we’re on a great path to be able to do that,” Wurster said.   In addition to trading services, Wurster revealed that Schwab plans to launch a stablecoin. He said the firm is exploring multiple pathways to deliver this stablecoin. This suggests openness to partnerships, in-house development, or leveraging existing blockchain infrastructure.  “Stablecoins are likely to play a role in transacting on blockchains, and that’s something we do want to be able to offer,” he said. “We will have a stablecoin at some point.”  The statement comes after the GENIUS Act,  which is meant to regulate stablecoins, was passed on Thursday by the US House.",DreamingTooLong,22,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1m3cmt4/charles_schwab_to_launch_bitcoin_and_ethereum/,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1m3cmt4/charles_schwab_to_launch_bitcoin_and_ethereum/

CryptoMarkets,1i87rzr,2025-01-23 16:48:43,"Movement is a Move-based blockchain network that seeks to improve the security, speed and efficiency of Ethereum","It works as a layer 2 (L2) solution on top of Ethereum, which means it processes transactions faster and cheaper without compromising security.  Here's a summary of what Movement offers for Ethereum:  * Move programming language: Movement uses the Move programming language, originally developed by Facebook (Meta). Move is designed to be more secure and efficient than Solidity, the most widely used language in Ethereum.  * It uses a resource-oriented programming model, where digital assets are treated as unique resources with strict rules about their creation and transfer. This reduces common vulnerabilities such as re-entry, overflows and underflows.  * Integrates Move Prover, a formal verification tool that analyzes code mathematically to detect vulnerabilities.  MoveVM: Movement uses the Move Virtual Machine (MoveVM), which is compatible with Move code and also with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) bytecode. This allows:    * Developers to deploy existing Solidity contracts on the MoveVM without the need to rewrite them in Move.  * Ethereum applications can take advantage of Move's security and efficiency without having to leave the Ethereum ecosystem.  * MoveVM enables parallel transaction execution, increasing performance and scalability, reaching up to 180,000 TPS.  M2: The main Movement layer 2 in Ethereum, also known as the first MEVM (Move + EVM) ZK L2 ZK in Ethereum, powered by Celestia.  Move rollups: Movement offers a flexible architecture where developers can create custom rollups for different applications such as DeFi, games or supply chains. These rollups can be optimistic (fraud proof) or zero-knowledge (validity proof).  Decentralized Shared Sequencer (DSS): Movement uses a decentralized sequencer that ensures fair and uncensored transaction processing. The DSS also facilitates interoperability between different blockchains within the Movement ecosystem.  Fast Finality Settlement Module: Movement uses a novel mechanism for fast transaction settlement. This module uses a network of validators that stake and certify the correctness of state changes, ensuring security and reducing latency.  Interoperability: Movement seeks interoperability by combining the EVM and Move ecosystem, creating a deep liquidity hub. In addition, it is compatible with other blockchain networks.  Move Stack: A set of tools, components and adapters that enable the creation of customizable Move-based blockchains. The Move Stack allows developers to select the most appropriate components for their applications, ensuring optimal performance and security.  Movement is an innovative network that seeks to empower Ethereum with the security and efficiency of the Move language, while maintaining compatibility with existing Ethereum applications. It offers a scalable solution for developers and users seeking a faster, cheaper and more secure experience in the blockchain ecosystem.

Perhaps the most intricate aspect of these initiatives is the EVM optimization, where Vitalik envisions using a new object format, EOF, to bring it to fruition.

I know the most common advice is to stick with Bitcoin or Ethereum since they’re the biggest and most established, but I’m also curious if there are any altcoins worth looking into for solid growth potential over the next few years. I’m not looking for a quick gamble or day trading, more of a medium to long-term investment where I can let it sit and hopefully grow. Do you think it makes sense to put it all into one coin, or would it be smarter to split it across a few different projects?

Retail still hesitant?","There's a steady shift happening, but a lot of people still don't seem to see it...  BTC is holding above $118K. ETH pushed past $3.1K. And ETH spot ETFs in the US have now recorded eight straight days of inflows - $192M on Monday alone, with BlackRock taking in $171M.  Meanwhile, Peter Thiel just picked up a 9% stake in BitMine Immersion Technologies, a company building an ETH treasury that now holds over 160K ETH. SharpLink just added another 6K ETH this week, bringing their total to 312K. And the Moscow Exchange is set to launch a new ETH ETF fund next month tied to BlackRock's product.  That's capital flowing in from multiple fronts - US, Europe, even Russia. Big players are accumulating quietly, yet retail sentiment still feels muted. The same people who called ETH undervalued at $2K are now calling $3.1K overbought. It's the same pattern every cycle.  From here, we probably grind higher while capital rotates. Disbelief is fuel. As long as the inflows keep coming and retail stays on the sidelines, BTC and ETH likely keep moving - slowly, structurally, and underexposed.  My take on all of this - ETH keeps grinding up while everyone's keeps waiting for a magical dip that's probably not coming. At some point this thing's going to rip and when it does - most will have already missed a golden opportunity and just FOMO in.

CryptoMarkets,1mbh8g8,2025-07-28 14:10:48,What if the ETH sell-off never comes this cycle?,"In previous cycles, we've seen a familiar pattern: ETH gains momentum, retail floods in, price peaks... and then the sell-off hits. The cycle (usually) repeats, but this time feels different.  SharpLink just accumulated over 438K ETH, making it the largest corporate ETH holder. BitMine's been scaling aggressively too. ETH ETF flows are exploding - $2.4B in just six trading days - and open interest is at all-time highs. Meanwhile, ETH dominance just hit 12% for the first time in five years.  In the past, people would sell into strength to take profits. But institutions don't trade that way - they're not rotating out at $4K or $5K - they're buying with multi-year horizons, using ETH for treasuries, staking, and long-term yield.  So here's the question: If the biggest players this cycle are accumulating, staking, and locking ETH into ETFs... is the sell-off even coming? And if it doesn't come, how are you planning to play it?  Some are stacking, some are earning passive yield, and some are borrowing against ETH using platforms like Nexo instead of selling at all. If ETH is really shifting into institutional asset territory, short-term exit plans might need a rethink.  So maybe this isn't just another retail-driven boom/bust setup. With ETFs, corporate treasuries, and long-term stakers stepping in, the dynamics are changing.   If ETH does break past $4K and beyond we might not see the sharp exit wave everyone's waiting for.

The ETH/BTC ratio doubled from its April low, and suddenly everyone's asking if Bitcoin is losing market share. but whats the reality?  i caught two takes today that got me thinking:  first, Samson Mow argues the recent eth rally is fueled by bitcoin holders rotating capital into eth for short-term gain...only to dump it once prices get high enough and shift profits back into btc. he calls this the “bagholder’s dilemma.” current eth/btc ratio is around 0.036, double its april low, but he warns eth faces a sell-off once it hits key psychological levels  Secomd, Willy Woo called Bitcoin the ""perfect asset for the next 1000 years"" - and looking at longer timeframes, the fundamentals remain unchanged. Bitcoin's market cap is still only 11% of gold's $23 trillion, meaning we're far from complete adoption.  The real question isn't whether ETH can pump another 12% to hit its ATH. It's whether Bitcoin continues building toward becoming a world reserve asset. And for that to happen, we need way more capital flowing in.  in short term flows, eth sees spikes from traders chasing yield, but profits often rotate back to btc  in long tem confidrence, btc remains the default store of value  in short, btc isn’t losing its dominance, capital flow dynamics shift over cycles, but fundamentals still favor bitcoin for many institutions. eth can rally within those windows, but its staying power depends on sustained narratives, not just hype. either way, if you're actively trading between eth and btc or taking profits on these moves, platforms like awaken.tax become pretty essential for tracking cost basis across all the swaps and rotations.",dumble_hold_the_door,31,40,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1mnw5pl/eth_vs_btc_what_is_the_reality/,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1mnw5pl/eth_vs_btc_what_is_the_reality/

I understand the basics, but that's about where it ends- I'm working on building my knowledge on this, but as of now, I'd trust that someone out there (in this community, hopefully)could give me good advice.

From my quick research, it seems like Ethereum is the currency to buy rn. Seeing as I'm not doing the best financially it might not even be a long term thing incase I need the cash soon, so I'm just looking to firstly do this as a way to not have my money easily accessible cause I tend to spend it on silly things like drinks/shots at the bar when I'm having a good time. So I'm looking for a currency where the amount I buy will stay the same or grow a few dollars by the time I need it-in, in a month or so. Or if things go well, I might leave it as ETH for much longer, and obviously, I'd want it to grow. I use Binance btw. Any help, knowledge, or ideas offered are welcome.

CryptoMarkets,1m47kyq,2025-07-19 21:29:11,why Solana might actually flip eth (and why it probably won't happen soon),"Look, the numbers don't lie. When you can do the same transaction on Solana for cents instead of tens of dollars on Ethereum, that's a massive advantage.. eth gas fees are a total pain. Like, why pay a fortune for the same thing when SOL does it quicker and for less? someone mentioned on one of the threads dropping $150 on a new ERC20 memecoin launch and getting hit with $94 in gas fees. that’s nyts.When you're tracking all these transactions for tax reporting with tools like awaken.tax, those gas fees really add up and eat into your actual gains. Solana's speed is also insane compared to ETH. Everything feels instant, and when you're trying to catch a quick trade or mint something, those seconds matter. The whole network just feels more responsive for actual usage.  But here's why ETH isn't going anywhere anytime soon:- The developer ecosystem is just massive. We're talking about thousands of developers who have spent years building on Ethereum, creating tools, learning the ins and outs of smart contracts, building entire careers around it. That doesn't just disappear overnight. All those dApps, DeFi protocols, NFT marketplaces - they're not going to migrate easily. There's so much infrastructure built on Ethereum that moving would be like rebuilding the entire internet from scratch. If Solana does flip Ethereum, we're probably looking at 2028-2029 at the earliest. Maybe longer. These things take time, and network effects are incredibly powerful in crypto. Bitcoin is still #1 despite having way worse tech than newer chains, purely because it was first.  What do you think? Am I missing something about why ETH will stay dominant, or do you see the same shift happening?",hodorrny,0,32,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1m47kyq/why_solana_might_actually_flip_eth_and_why_it/,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1m47kyq/why_solana_might_actually_flip_eth_and_why_it/

That's their strongest performance yet, and honestly the competition between these two is getting pretty interesting.  The fascinating part is how ETH seems to be following BTC's playbook from early 2024. Remember when Bitcoin ETFs launched in January and everyone was skeptical, then it just kept climbing? ETH ETFs had the same lukewarm reception when they launched in July 2024, but now they're pulling massive numbers  $1.01B in net inflows just on Monday alone.  What's really got my attention is that ETH supply on exchanges just dropped to 12% while this is happening. So you've got decreasing supply, massive ETF inflows, and BTC setting the pace upward. Some analysts think ETH's new ATH is still weeks or months away, but honestly with how these ETFs are performing and the way they're pushing each other higher, I'm not so sure about that timeline.

CryptoMarkets,1k23tys,2025-04-18 12:33:48,If you're down a lot here's an ETH strategy that can help,"For the next year I expect ETH to climb, in fact I can be extra specific and say ETH will go to at the very least to $3,346.50 due to that being where the CME gap is in the daily futures chart for ETH. If you set your chart timeframe to the monthly candlesticks you'll see that ETH Dominance, ETH/BTC are bottomed out so a reverse is imminent.  With all that in mind, you're probably thinking a 98% pump from ETH's current price to $3.3k is nowhere near enough money to recover from your recent losses. Let's say you started with $15,000 and are now down to $4,000, your portfolio being at $8k by longing ETH while good isn't enough to satisfy going all in... Or is it?  If you need to go back to $15k and ETH is basically guarantee going to $3.3k due to the nature of cme gaps, that means right now your goal is getting 4.483 ETH before ETH gets to $3.3k. Which is currently worth $7122.41. So that's your goal, getting to 4.483 eth which is easier right now than trying to get to $15k from $4k  It's my current strat after having lost a bit, even when in not holding ETH my portfolio currency is set to ETH so no matter what coin I hold I can see my progress on getting eth to where it needs to be before it pumps. Holding stablecoins while eth is going down and you have your portfolio set to ETH means you'll see your eth go up even during downtrends.  $15,000 % $3,346.50 = 4.482 ETH",wraithoffaith,0,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1k23tys/if_youre_down_a_lot_heres_an_eth_strategy_that/,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1k23tys/if_youre_down_a_lot_heres_an_eth_strategy_that/

Like many, I got in with zero experience, thinking I’d get rich fast. Spoiler: I didn’t.  Bought TRX, XRP, and a bunch of random altcoins. Lost $2,700 in a few months. Then I tried margin trading (big mistake), got liquidated, and was left staring at an empty account. Honestly, I almost quit.  In 2019, I decided to stop gambling and start learning. I studied charts, watched real traders, read books, and backtested strategies. I didn’t trade real money for a while—just practiced and journaled everything.  By 2020, I was finally making small profits. Took only setups I trusted, avoided hype, and managed risk properly. Made around $4,800 on a $3K account. Nothing crazy, but it felt earned.  2021 bull run? I was ready. I grew my account to over $43K trading ETH, SOL, and a few strong alts. But I got cocky, messed with leverage again, and gave back a chunk. That lesson hurt, but it stuck.  2022 was survival mode. I traded less, avoided trying to “buy the dip,” and focused on capital preservation. Profits were small, but I didn’t lose.  From 2023 to now, I’ve kept it boring: 1% risk per trade, only 2–3 reliable setups, and strict journaling. I don’t trade every day. I don’t chase pumps. I just stick to what works.  In 2024, I crossed $100K in my trading account. No moonshots. Just consistency over time.  TL;DR  Lost money in 2018 (like most beginners) Started learning & tracking everything in 2019 Profitable by 2020, stayed consistent Bull run helped, but greed punished me in 2021 Focused on capital protection in 2022 2023–2025: steady growth, no drama Finally passed $100K in 2024 Biggest Lessons:  You won’t get rich overnight.

This is entirely built through AI Tools Like Cursor and ChatGPT, which is amazing for the community, it was pretty inspiring to me that now anything is literally possible. So if you have an idea build it, if I can build something, I promise anyone can!  **📊 Key Feature**s  ✅ Live data updates on ETH ETF flows   ✅ Bitcoin & Ethereum ETF inflow/outflow trends   ✅ Breakdown of ETF flows by specific ETFs  **💬 Looking for Feedback**!  The tool is 100% free and always will be, and I’d love your input:  • What features would be most useful to you?   • Are there any data points you’d like to see added?   • What should I build next (IE - strategic bitcoin reserve tracker, etc...)  I’m open to all feedback and looking to improve it based on what the people actually want in a way that looks great too.  🔗 Check it out here: [https://coinflows.org/](https://coinflows.org/) ",One_Athlete3271,2,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1jaf07e/i_made_a_website_to_monitor_btc_eth_etf_flow_with/,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1jaf07e/i_made_a_website_to_monitor_btc_eth_etf_flow_with/

CryptoMarkets,1kftun1,2025-05-06 02:29:04,"ETH is stuck because of L2 leverage, fake volume, and no real demand","ETH price isn’t moving, and a big part of it goes back to how the Ethereum Foundation helped create the L2 ecosystem. A lot of ETH was lent or allocated off-exchange to bootstrap rollups like Matic, Optimism, Arbitrum, StarkNet, etc. The goal was vertical scaling and more transaction throughput without stressing mainnet.  But here’s the issue: most of these L2s didn’t take off. Real usage is weak. Most activity is short-term (airdrops, farming), and their tokens are easy to manipulate, low market cap, thin liquidity. That made it tempting to artificially pump them and inflate transaction volume, which gets mirrored back onto Ethereum mainnet as if it’s legit demand. It’s not.  Meanwhile, ETH is locked in staking or buried in contracts, so there's no real spot pressure. No liquidation risk, no reflexive price movement. Smart money saw the setup and shorted. Retail never came back. NFTs are dead, DeFi’s stale, and ETH just flatlined.  The worst part? While this was happening, the ETH Foundation sold near local tops. Retail took the exit bags.  And while Ethereum focused on fragmented L2s, **Solana quietly scaled vertically, on a single chain, and took the market**. It’s now eating ETH’s lunch in active users, stablecoin velocity, and developer mindshare. Even **Sui**, of all things, is starting to eat into ETH’s dominance. The market’s moving on.  ETH might bounce a bit during altseason, but the structural issues aren’t going away.     Whole L2 non-sense backfired, pretty bad.",nullpointer2x,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1kftun1/eth_is_stuck_because_of_l2_leverage_fake_volume/,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1kftun1/eth_is_stuck_because_of_l2_leverage_fake_volume/
