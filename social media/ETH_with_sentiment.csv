ethereum,1khr5ey,2025-05-08 14:14:00,ETH is a store of value and scaling Ethereum will make it undeniable,"As we scale on L1 and L2, there's a couple things to keep in mind about how it affects ETH, tokenomics, and how it's viewed by the world:  1. As L1 gas limits and blobs increase, the deflationary threshold decreases proportionally. For example, right now the L1 gas limit is at 36M and the deflationary threshold it 14.5 gwei. At a 300M gas limit the deflationary threshold becomes 1.74 gwei (14.5gwei\*36M/300M). 2. As it becomes cheaper to use L1 and L2, that scaling creates potential/opportunity for new/different usecases which increases demand. For example, [this game](https://x.com/megaeth_labs/status/1913249693196599615) or [this game](https://x.com/IAmNickDodson/status/1919762394797982135) where every action is onchain is a new possibility that will fill in **low** cost blockspace. Unbanked usecases like subscriptions and payment streams such as access to games, blogs, licensing (music, shows, patents, trademarks), services (food delivery, hosting), rentals (physical goods), etc will consume **medium** cost blockspace. Complex compounded defi strategies and arbitrage will consume **high** cost blockspace. 3. As Ethereum scales and gas prices become lower, the willingness to pay a demand premium increases. For example, if normal gas prices are $0.01 a user will be much more willing to opay a 100% demand premium ($0.02) at times of higher congestion than they would pre-scaling ($5 -> $10). The lower prices get, the more price insensitive people become to congestion pricing. 4. These previous 3 points will lead to a substantial increase in burn rate, increasing scarcity and demand of ETH. Increased acceptance and usage of defi will further increase demand for ETH as a credibly neutral and permissionless collateral. 5. 30% of ETH supply is locked in staking to secure the network and the activity on top of it, further increasing scarcity and demand for ETH. 6. As Ethereum scales and the world comes onchain, this increased demand for ETH will secure it's place as a store of value and carry immense monetary premium.

Brew some coffee, kick back, and give this a read.  Please help boost Etherealize's [announcement tweet](https://x.com/etherealize_io/status/1933148258768929165)  ---  **Why is this important?**  - It refocuses ETH to be recognized as a store of value and priced as a commodity (rather than stupid valuations like DCF) - ETF providers have claimed they haven't been pushing ETH because they didn't know how to market it (I know, pathetic). Now there's a playbook with a clear narrative for ETF providers, family offices, account managers, etc to use for marketing ETH. - News outlets will now have educated and consistent messaging to use when talking about ETH and Ethereum. - It provides united messaging to others in the ecosystem to use and hammer home. - This is being distributed globally with content in multiple languages.  **Why digital oil?**  - This is the narrative that Etherealize found resonated the most when talking to institutions.

ethereum,1jja457,2025-03-25 03:21:16,ETH Token Utility Is Deteriorating: A Rollup-Centric Ethereum Needs Rethinking,"This is not a price discussion about ETH token —this post focuses on Ethereum's evolving architecture and how current design choices affect ETH’s role within the protocol.  Specifically, I wanted to discuss (hopefully with Ethereum Foundation members and the community here) how Ethereum’s shift toward a rollup-centric architecture—combined with sequencer economics and abstracted fee mechanisms—is steadily eroding the utility of ETH as a protocol asset. As transaction execution moves off-chain and value accrues to application and infrastructure layers, ETH is becoming economically obsolete within its own ecosystem, reduced to a passive settlement token with declining relevance.  \_  Ethereum’s recent market underperformance reflects underlying architectural and economic challenges—namely, an increasing divergence between protocol-level activity and value accrual to the ETH token. As Ethereum transitions toward a modular architecture, with execution increasingly offloaded to Layer 2 rollups and sidechains, the locus of network activity and fee generation is shifting away from the base layer. This raises critical questions about ETH’s function as a utility and capital asset within a system where settlement and data availability remain on L1, but economic activity is abstracted and fragmented across secondary layers.  Layer 2 networks and Ethereum-adjacent sidechains increasingly leverage Ethereum’s ecosystem—its security model, TVL, and EVM compatibility—while largely bypassing ETH as a core economic asset. These platforms benefit from Ethereum’s ecosystem, but redirect liquidity, transaction volume, and value accrual to their own native tokens and network.  Polygon, for example, positioned itself early on as an Ethereum scaling solution and received support from Ethereum Foundation + Vitalik. However, its architecture relies on its own validators, consensus model, and token (MATIC/POL), which is used for both transaction fees and staking. As a result, Polygon leeches from Ethereum's network, TVL, and developer network without reinforcing ETH as a utility token or contributing to the security of Ethereum mainnet.  L2 solutions such as Base, Arbitrum, and Optimism are structurally closer to Ethereum, in that they settle data to Layer 1. However, their economic models often do not reinforce ETH demand in a meaningful way. Sequencers collect fees and periodically post transaction data to Ethereum mainnet using ETH or their own native UI currencies—but in many cases (e.g., Coinbase’s Base), this ETH is sold immediately. The result is an increase in ETH-denominated sell pressure for using a L2 network without any corresponding increase in demand or utility. The amount of ETH burned is extremely small compared to the value being moved across these L2s. For billions in daily transaction volume, the total ETH burned is typically in the hundreds to low thousands per month. So while ETH is used, it’s economically disproportionate to the scale of activity happening off-chain.  Moreover, the abstraction of ETH from end users further erodes its role as a utility token. If rollups and applications can operate entirely using other network-specific tokens, and if ETH is only used behind the scenes (and immediately sold), its function as a transactional or capital asset becomes increasingly marginal. In effect, ETH risks being reduced to a mere settlement token for rollup operators, rather than a broadly used currency or store of value within the ecosystem.  The Ethereum Foundation continues to champion a rollup-centric roadmap as the path toward scalable, decentralized infrastructure. While this model offers tangible benefits—lower transaction costs/higher throughput—it also creates new economic trade-offs. Value accrual shifts to application and infrastructure layers, rather than consolidating around the base protocol asset (ETH). This is a departure from Ethereum’s earlier design assumptions, where ETH was envisioned as a multi-functional asset: the native gas token, staking collateral, medium of exchange, and reserve currency for decentralized applications.  As a long-time participant in the Ethereum ecosystem (since 2015-2016 or so), I’ve observed this shift with increasing concern—not due to a lack of technical progress, but due to the weakening alignment between protocol growth and ETH value. Ethereum is scaling, but ETH is not capturing the upside of that scale. Competing ecosystems—such as Solana or vertically integrated L1s—are increasingly offering tighter economic alignment between usage and token utility, which may present challenges to Ethereum’s long-term competitiveness.  This is a critical juncture. Ethereum must balance scalability with economic coherence. If Ethereum becomes primarily a settlement layer for EVM-compatible rollups that abstract away ETH, then ETH’s utility—and by extension, its long-term value proposition—will disappear.  \_  TL;DR: ETH is being abstracted away from Ethereum network + ecosystem usage, and needs to be fixed.

Specifically, I wanted to discuss (hopefully with Ethereum Foundation members and the community here) how Ethereum’s shift toward a rollup-centric architecture—combined with sequencer economics and abstracted fee mechanisms—is steadily eroding the utility of ETH as a protocol asset. As transaction execution moves off-chain and value accrues to application and infrastructure layers, ETH is becoming economically obsolete within its own ecosystem, reduced to a passive settlement token with declining relevance.  \_  Ethereum’s recent market underperformance reflects underlying architectural and economic challenges—namely, an increasing divergence between protocol-level activity and value accrual to the ETH token. As Ethereum transitions toward a modular architecture, with execution increasingly offloaded to Layer 2 rollups and sidechains, the locus of network activity and fee generation is shifting away from the base layer. This raises critical questions about ETH’s function as a utility and capital asset within a system where settlement and data availability remain on L1, but economic activity is abstracted and fragmented across secondary layers.  Layer 2 networks and Ethereum-adjacent sidechains increasingly leverage Ethereum’s ecosystem—its security model, TVL, and EVM compatibility—while largely bypassing ETH as a core economic asset. These platforms benefit from Ethereum’s ecosystem, but redirect liquidity, transaction volume, and value accrual to their own native tokens and network.  Polygon, for example, positioned itself early on as an Ethereum scaling solution and received support from Ethereum Foundation + Vitalik. However, its architecture relies on its own validators, consensus model, and token (MATIC/POL), which is used for both transaction fees and staking. As a result, Polygon leeches from Ethereum's network, TVL, and developer network without reinforcing ETH as a utility token or contributing to the security of Ethereum mainnet.  L2 solutions such as Base, Arbitrum, and Optimism are structurally closer to Ethereum, in that they settle data to Layer 1. However, their economic models often do not reinforce ETH demand in a meaningful way. Sequencers collect fees and periodically post transaction data to Ethereum mainnet using ETH or their own native UI currencies—but in many cases (e.g., Coinbase’s Base), this ETH is sold immediately. The result is an increase in ETH-denominated sell pressure for using a L2 network without any corresponding increase in demand or utility. The amount of ETH burned is extremely small compared to the value being moved across these L2s. For billions in daily transaction volume, the total ETH burned is typically in the hundreds to low thousands per month. So while ETH is used, it’s economically disproportionate to the scale of activity happening off-chain.  Moreover, the abstraction of ETH from end users further erodes its role as a utility token. If rollups and applications can operate entirely using other network-specific tokens, and if ETH is only used behind the scenes (and immediately sold), its function as a transactional or capital asset becomes increasingly marginal. In effect, ETH risks being reduced to a mere settlement token for rollup operators, rather than a broadly used currency or store of value within the ecosystem.  The Ethereum Foundation continues to champion a rollup-centric roadmap as the path toward scalable, decentralized infrastructure. While this model offers tangible benefits—lower transaction costs/higher throughput—it also creates new economic trade-offs. Value accrual shifts to application and infrastructure layers, rather than consolidating around the base protocol asset (ETH). This is a departure from Ethereum’s earlier design assumptions, where ETH was envisioned as a multi-functional asset: the native gas token, staking collateral, medium of exchange, and reserve currency for decentralized applications.  As a long-time participant in the Ethereum ecosystem (since 2015-2016 or so), I’ve observed this shift with increasing concern—not due to a lack of technical progress, but due to the weakening alignment between protocol growth and ETH value. Ethereum is scaling, but ETH is not capturing the upside of that scale. Competing ecosystems—such as Solana or vertically integrated L1s—are increasingly offering tighter economic alignment between usage and token utility, which may present challenges to Ethereum’s long-term competitiveness.  This is a critical juncture. Ethereum must balance scalability with economic coherence. If Ethereum becomes primarily a settlement layer for EVM-compatible rollups that abstract away ETH, then ETH’s utility—and by extension, its long-term value proposition—will disappear.  \_  TL;DR: ETH is being abstracted away from Ethereum network + ecosystem usage, and needs to be fixed.

ethtrader,1n87dkx,2025-09-04 11:19:01,The case for ETH going to $12k.. or even $62k.,"Tom Lee (from Fundstrat) thinks there is a big chance ETH could hit $62k. Milk Road's Twitter account did an analysis to verify the possibility of this prediction happening. If Bitcoin climbs to $250k then ETH's value depends on its ratio to BTC. Over the last 8 years that ratio was on average 0.048. At that ratio level ETH is worth around $12k (if BTC goes to $250k). If it goes back to the 2021 high of 0.087, we get $22k.  Tom Lee says that is not all. Ethereum is turning into the backbone of finance, like the foundation for payments and banking. If it replaces old systems the ratio pumps to 0.25, pushing ETH all the way up to $62k. How does that sound? I like this idea xD. Right now Ethereum leads in DeFi with about 60% of the locked value, over $153 billion this year. Sure, there are still competitors like Ripple or Solana, Cardano.. but look at Ethereum's growth.  One might wonder if this is too optimistic. First Bitcoin needs to rally and the market changes fast. Still if Ethereum keeps building, this target is not impossible if you really think about it. If you believe this is possible it could change how you invest.  *Source: https://x.com/MilkRoadDaily/status/1963001300951695419*",MasterpieceLoud4931,257,188,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1n87dkx/the_case_for_eth_going_to_12k_or_even_62k/,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1n87dkx/the_case_for_eth_going_to_12k_or_even_62k/,"The case for ETH going to $12k.. or even $62k.

ethtrader,1kdzdpb,2025-05-03 18:15:30,Why is Ethereum doing so insanely bad,"Hi everyone,   I'm new to the crypto space and looking to buy my first positions. Over the past few weeks, I’ve spent a lot of time researching different projects – and I keep coming back to Ethereum.  I’ve mostly invested in stocks before, and I usually base my decisions on what companies are building for the future or what role they could play long term. Applying the same thinking to crypto, Ethereum stood out to me. Here’s what I’ve found so far:  **Why Ethereum makes sense to me:**  *  Ethereum might be officially classified as a *commodity*, not a *security* – which would open the door for big funds and banks to invest freely * Visa is running a tokenization pilot on Ethereum and plans to go live in 2025, with banks like BBVA involved *  BlackRock is testing a $150 billion tokenized Treasury fund on Ethereum infrastructure *  Ethereum’s staking model + burn mechanism make it potentially deflationary over time *  Ethereum is already being used for real-world asset (RWA) tokenization – stocks, bonds, even real estate  **But here’s my problem:**  Despite all of this, **Ethereum’s price is just SUCK** around $1800. It feels like nothing is moving or better: The price doesn’t reflect what Ethereum is actually capable of.. I’m used to seeing assets go up when the fundamentals are strong, so this makes me hesitant to buy. No matter how much good news comes out about Ethereum, the price just doesn’t move.  I’m wondering if I’m missing something?  I’d love to hear your thoughts – especially from long-term ETH holders. Why is ETH still lagging? And do you think that will change soon?

I’ve been in an absolute rabbit hole for the past week ever since the thought hit me: ""Which cryptocurrency should I invest in?""  Of course, I stumbled across the usual suspects: Solana, Bitcoin, XRP, etc. But one in particular really caught my attention: Ethereum.   How is it possible that Ethereum is the second biggest cryptocurrency, but still feels so ""cheap"" and barely moves in price?  So I started digging.   At first, I ended up on YouTube—like pretty much everyone. YouTubers doing all sorts of chart analysis. At first, it seemed plausible. But then I went back and watched some of their older videos, and guess what? Not a single one of their predictions came even remotely true.  Next, I moved on to crypto news YouTubers. But they all gave off this vibe of ""How do I get the most views the fastest?"" Some of it was informed, yes—but the promises were way too big and way too fast. Not for me. I don’t buy into that.   My motto has always been: Buy, hold, forget, celebrate in 1–3 years.  Naturally, I ended up in some forums. And the opinions on Ethereum couldn’t have been more divided. From “Ethereum is the best thing ever” to “Ethereum is so slow and trash.”   I think people are just frustrated because Ethereum is so volatile.  Up to this point, I guess most people have taken the same path.   And by now, 5 days had already passed.  After that, I made a post in this thread.: ""Why is ETH so undervalued?""   I expected maybe 3–4 replies.   Boom: Over 200 replies. And zero consensus.  That’s when I thought: Why not go straight to the root?  So I started watching tons of interviews with Vitalik from 2020–2025, tracked Ethereum’s development, watched BlackRock interviews—especially with Larry Fink—and looked into how Ethereum has changed over the years.  Ethereum was always cool, but it never focused on marketing. Only a tiny fraction of people even understand what ETH actually is.   But earlier this year, Ethereum launched something called Etherealize—which is aimed specifically at changing that, to finally start marketing Ethereum properly.  All of this, combined with BlackRock saying that everything will be built on ETH, and the fact that other companies also put ETH first, led me to this conclusion:  Ethereum is a caterpillar that’s turning into a GIGA MEGA ULTRA butterfly.  And here’s why I think that:  1. Ethereum realized their public image sucks. They appointed two co-directors to strengthen leadership. 2. Etherealize is actively reaching out to potential clients to pitch Ethereum. 3. BlackRock is backing Ethereum, and in an interview, it was said that other companies also put ETH at the top. 4. Last year, Larry Fink said in an interview that he wants to tokenize all of BlackRock’s assets because he’s convinced that’s the future. 5. This year, Fink repeated in another interview that the SEC needs to hurry up because tokenization would simplify so much. 6. Within just two months, BlackRock poured $2.2 billion into the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund. Before that, they had invested only $600 million over the course of an entire year. 7. Ethereum still holds the largest market share—by far. 8. BlackRock plans to tokenize its $150 billion Treasury Trust Fund. While they didn’t officially say it’ll be on ETH, the signs are obvious. In a recent interview at Etherealize, it was hinted that BlackRock did choose ETH. Also, they previously ran a very successful pilot project on Ethereum. 9. Other companies are jumping on the ETH bandwagon too. 10. The president’s son literally said it’s a good time to buy ETH—even when it was still over $2K.  Okay… there’s a lot more I could say.

ethtrader,1nezd1q,2025-09-12 10:15:27,Michael Saylor accidentally explained why Ethereum wins.,"Michael Saylor has always been Bitcoin's biggest supporter. For years he talked about how BTC is the ultimate store of value, digital gold that does not need yield at all. An interesting old clip came up where Saylor admits something ironic: if he put $100 billion in Bitcoin and it generates 0% return, it is no different than holding bonds that pay nothing. In his own words.. that makes it a 'non-performing asset.'  Etheraider (Ethereum community member) commented on this clip on Twitter, saying what many of us already know: Saylor wishes Bitcoin was more like Ethereum. Ethereum staking changed everything.. instead of just holding and hoping price goes up ETH holders can earn yield directly from the network. That yield is native, secured by the protocol and it keeps capital productive. Meanwhile Bitcoin still offers no return at all. Let's look at the bigger picture, this is not just Saylor talking. Institutions are moving to crypto and they want assets that work for them. That is why Ethereum is the best choice.  If even Bitcoin's biggest believer recognized the problem then maybe it is time to admit it: Ethereum is doing what Bitcoin cannot do.

In 2017 the ICO hype flooded the network which made the fees very high. In 2021 NFTs did the exact same thing. Each time high costs limited network activity, so they were a soft cap on how far ETH could go.  This cycle things are very different. As DCinvestor points out on Twitter, most on-chain activity moved to Ethereum's L2 networks. L2s take care of transactions faster and cheaper so now the base layer is not limited like before. This thing alone already removes a big cap on Ethereum's growth. The other change is just as important: demand for ETH is no longer coming only from on-chain activity. Treasury companies and ETFs are entering the scene and they are creating huge demand that is unaffected by gas fees or network congestion.  But what does this mean?? Together these changes mean we are heading into uncharted territory. The limits that kept ETH in chains before are gone. With more capacity, lower costs and new demand sources this bull market could make ETH go far higher than most are expecting. This will be a different cycle, it is the first one where Ethereum can really scale and that makes the upside harder to measure and easier to underestimate.

ethtrader,1kh56pn,2025-05-07 18:47:36,Ethereum Just Upgraded. The Market Yawned.,"I've seen a few comments today from people complaining that Ethereum's price isn’t moving after the update. But honestly, I expected this. The masses aren't really into Ethereum like that. We're a small group of niche nerds who follow these upgrades closely – the average person doesn’t even know this happened. But let’s not forget: most people don’t see the big picture. So let’s break it down, one by one:  **What the Pectra Upgrade Actually Changes**  1. **More ETH per Validator** → Institutions can now stake more ETH per validator (from 32 ETH to 2048 ETH). Easier for big players. 2. **Smart Wallets**  → Wallets can now act like smart contracts. Pay gas with any token, bundle transactions, better security. 3. **More Data per Block** → Ethereum can now handle twice the ""blob"" data. That helps Layer-2s scale faster and cheaper. 4. **Better User Experience (under the hood)** → Several technical improvements make Ethereum smoother for developers and future upgrades.  Big companies move slowly, and it will take time to sell this to them. On top of that, the lack of a clear classification from the SEC remains a major risk factor.

Yes, you are thinking it right, another All  Time High has been reached! From L1 to L2s like (Base, Arbitrum, zkSync, etc.) the whole ecosystem is viving with insane activity.  Even thought ETH hasn't reached a new price ATH yet, Ethereum keeps evolving in all its aspects and it is scaling horizontally. Billions are flowing across rollups, DeFi is becoming active again and even NFTs are trying to resurrect again.  FUD narratives like Ethereum is too slow and expensive, L2s are killing Ethereum, are dying. Gas fees on L2s are pennies and builders are back. Devs never left.  A new Era is being built in front of our eyes and it is our duty to take advantage to try to improve our lives the best we can correctly deciding where we put our money. From my point of view, Ethereum ecosystem is a pretty obvious choice.  There won't be a future where Ethereum is not everywhere.

Just crossed with this Leon [Tweet ](https://x.com/LeonWaidmann/status/1948149879924277402)talking about transaction count and how Ethereum ecosystem keeps booming and it is really bullish.  https://preview.redd.it/5r9m9e3nhref1.png?width=1171&format=png&auto=webp&s=82f13802751521469a9ee0bf0c6803db9508ae6e  As you can see in the chart above, Ethereum ecosystem is booming reaching 24.69 million transactions processed daily across the Ethereum ecosystem. Yes, you are thinking it right, another All  Time High has been reached! From L1 to L2s like (Base, Arbitrum, zkSync, etc.) the whole ecosystem is viving with insane activity.  Even thought ETH hasn't reached a new price ATH yet, Ethereum keeps evolving in all its aspects and it is scaling horizontally. Billions are flowing across rollups, DeFi is becoming active again and even NFTs are trying to resurrect again.  FUD narratives like Ethereum is too slow and expensive, L2s are killing Ethereum, are dying. Gas fees on L2s are pennies and builders are back. Devs never left.  A new Era is being built in front of our eyes and it is our duty to take advantage to try to improve our lives the best we can correctly deciding where we put our money. From my point of view, Ethereum ecosystem is a pretty obvious choice.  There won't be a future where Ethereum is not everywhere.

ethtrader,1ltse0l,2025-07-07 12:04:37,Corporations might ditch Bitcoin for Ethereum.,"Nett0eth, an Ethereum content creator, posted a long thread on Twitter talking about the 'ETH Strategy'. The ETH Strategy, eth_strategy on Twitter, is a DeFi protocol that is 'saving Ethereum.' This is inspired by MicroStrategy's Bitcoin strategy and the system lets users deposit stablecoins to gain leveraged Ethereum exposure but without liquidation risks. It uses a mix of 4.2-year convertible debt and NFT options. This is very useful and I think it is a sign Ethereum is destined to outshine Bitcoin in the corporate world.  ETH Strategy connects with Ethereum's ecosystem. ETF approvals and the L2 hype are making it a magnet for institutions. Ethereum gives staking yields and all of this combined means Ethereum offers utility Bitcoin cannot possibly match. Ethereum is not only just a store of value, it also supports apps, stablecoins, and real-world assets. The protocol's transparency gives corporations a practical reason to jump in.  Bitcoin has static appeal and it is starting to fade away. Ethereum is more versatile, it has leveraged exposure without volatility and this means companies can grow their treasuries. As more institutions adopt ETH Strategy and similar initiatives it is only a matter of time before ETH becomes the institutional crypto of choice.

ethtrader,1hh2qop,2024-12-18 14:28:15,Ethereum is the king,(Im going to try to make this look as unbiased as possible)  Ethereum is still the king of crypto and its wild to think how undervalued it feels right now  First of all: security. Ethereum is hands down the most secure blockchain in the space. Its constantly being upgraded - its a fortress at this point. Billions of dollars in assets live on Ethereum and for good reason - its because people trust it. When it comes to building in crypto security is most likely the most important thing  This is a no brainer and everyone knows this but Ethereum invented Defi - it also still hosts the biggest ecosystem in the sector.

Ethereum is hands down the most secure blockchain in the space. Its constantly being upgraded - its a fortress at this point. Billions of dollars in assets live on Ethereum and for good reason - its because people trust it. When it comes to building in crypto security is most likely the most important thing  This is a no brainer and everyone knows this but Ethereum invented Defi - it also still hosts the biggest ecosystem in the sector.

In stakeyour.eth's post you can see images showing 2020-2024 as a chaotic 'market' of VCs and gamblers. But in 2025 it gets a lot better: TradFi adoption, real capital and a mature network. Ethereum's transaction fees were behind Bitcoin's, proving early neglect of fundamentals. Fees were often higher and less efficient compared to Bitcoin at that time and this gap showed us Ethereum was not optimizing its core tech, like speed and cost-effectiveness.

ethtrader,1nk63ys,2025-09-18 11:50:12,Even ETH maxis admit Bitcoin could hit $200k. Ethereum's value is not measured in price targets.,"Something very ironic is that even the biggest Ethereum supporters are saying that Bitcoin can go to $200k. On Twitter a self-described ETH maxi called materkel.eth says the reason BTC can go to that price is that crypto has never seen this kind of institutional demand. With Wall Street entering the game BTC's price action looks secondary.  The point here is what stands out is not the prediction itself but the attitude. You can criticize networks without turning it into an online warfare. Too often discussions about Ethereum x Bitcoin, or any other chain really, get reduced to mudslinging over coin prices. In his tweet materkel.eth makes a point that matters, the performance of individual coins today is a small piece of a much bigger story. Ethereum has never been about chasing the charts, it is about building the ground for a new financial system. Whether BTC goes to $200k, $300k or even higher it does not change what Ethereum is set up to do, which is to reshape global markets with a programmable and decentralized base layer.

Ethereum's value is not measured in price targets. Something very ironic is that even the biggest Ethereum supporters are saying that Bitcoin can go to $200k. On Twitter a self-described ETH maxi called materkel.eth says the reason BTC can go to that price is that crypto has never seen this kind of institutional demand. With Wall Street entering the game BTC's price action looks secondary.  The point here is what stands out is not the prediction itself but the attitude. You can criticize networks without turning it into an online warfare. Too often discussions about Ethereum x Bitcoin, or any other chain really, get reduced to mudslinging over coin prices. In his tweet materkel.eth makes a point that matters, the performance of individual coins today is a small piece of a much bigger story. Ethereum has never been about chasing the charts, it is about building the ground for a new financial system. Whether BTC goes to $200k, $300k or even higher it does not change what Ethereum is set up to do, which is to reshape global markets with a programmable and decentralized base layer.  Both coins can win in their own lanes and if institutions keep buying in then they likely will.

ethtrader,1ktgjuc,2025-05-23 10:53:16,"Ethereum will hit $100k in the next 4 Years, here is why:","Hear me out:  One of the obvious drivers is staking. As more ETH gets staked, it becomes locked and unavailable for trading. This isn’t just theoretical scarcity — it’s enforced illiquidity. But let’s be honest: staking is just one piece of the puzzle. Yes, it restricts supply. Yes, it’s sticky. But it’s not the core reason Ethereum can hit $100K. It’s a small stone in a much larger foundation.  If you look across different charts and macro trends, one thing becomes crystal clear:  Ethereum is becoming the base layer for tokenized real-world assets — government bonds, real estate, equities, stablecoins, and more. Institutional players and fintech platforms are building on Ethereum. And that matters. For finance to operate on a global scale, it needs trustless, permissionless, borderless infrastructure. Ethereum is the only serious option right now that checks all those boxes.  Yes, there’s still the regulatory overhang — how will Ethereum be classified? But come on. The signals from the SEC are positive. The U.S. government has a clear incentive to classify ETH as a commodity. BlackRock wants it to be a commodity. The entire financial world is leaning in that direction. And even if it takes time — the trajectory is clear.  Meanwhile, institutions are beginning to treat ETH not just as a protocol — but as a balance sheet asset. Just look at Coinbase: they now hold ETH in their treasury. This is only the beginning. As more corporations start adding ETH as a reserve asset, it unlocks a completely new demand layer — and further anchors Ethereum as the monetary base of tokenized finance.  To reach $100K per ETH, we’d need somewhere around $10–12 trillion in real-world assets to be tokenized. That may sound bold, but it’s not crazy — it’s actually realistic. The global bond market alone is over $130 trillion. Even a small fraction migrating on-chain gives ETH explosive upside.  Hate me all you want — but I believe in this.  We're going to make it.

ethtrader,1legsin,2025-06-18 13:14:00,Why the silence on Ethereum? Big players are holding back and it is weird.,"The well-known Ethereum educator and investor sassal.eth posted a very interesting tweet yesterday. He said, and I quote, that 'this whole Coinbase doesn't have to talk about Ethereum thing is just dumb.' Ethereum has been at the center of some of the biggest moves in crypto, especially recently. Yet the silence from big players like Coinbase, BlackRock, and even Trump is weird.  Let's take Coinbase, they own 137,000 ETH, run a top-tier staking service and on top of that they created Base, an Ethereum L2 that handles millions of transactions every month. Coinbase put serious money into ETH and yet they barely hype it. BlackRock is another example, they have the iShares Ethereum Trust ETF but do not talk about ETH often or at all. Even Trump, he is very involved in crypto now. Trump never talked about ETH despite better regulations that are good for not only Ethereum but the entire crypto sector. And he obviously holds ETH too!!  This silence feels very weird, these giants have a lot invested in Ethereum, financially and infrastructurally. But they are not talking about Ethereum's potential. So.. are they focusing on the long-term, accumulating ETH under the radar before going bullish?? Or is this strategic and they are avoiding competition? They could be wary of regulatory pushback or just don't want to ruin everything. Whatever the reason it is frustrating. Ethereum is eco-friendly and has staking rewards, because of this alone it should be front-page news. This silence hints at secret reasons, and as an ETH fan I have to ask why are they not sharing ETH vocally when they have so much to gain?

ethtrader,1k57l3s,2025-04-22 14:24:03,Whales are betting big on Ethereum. Here’s why you should care.,"Today I was analyzing the social media sentiment about ETH, and during my research I came across an interesting tweet. A 26 year old investor known as 'Crypto Beast' on Twitter made a very bold play. He sold $3 million of his S&P 500 stocks, basically his entire retirement fund, and went all in on Ethereum. He currently has 6,337.375 ETH, worth over $10 million, at least that we know about.  The reason why Crypto Beast did this was because everyone on crypto Twitter is very bearish on ETH, and he sees that as the ultimate buy signal. That is real conviction!! However Crypto Beast isn’t alone. Whales are starting to get bullish on ETH, even as the market sentiment stays negative. A bearish trend usually creates fear, but that is exactly when smart investors 'attack'. Ethereum’s price volatility is a big factor here, making it risky, but it is also a potential goldmine if you time it right.  Crypto Beast is aiming for a 3x return, aiming for $30 million. Other whales are making similar moves, buying millions in ETH despite the trash talk. Meanwhile Ethereum keeps showing it is full of life. So while everyone is fading ETH these whales are doubling down. Are they crazy or onto something huge?? I am definitely ready to ride.

This is not just a blip, its a straight up signal and we are witnessing a level of activity that could soon break all time high. No matter where you do it, deep in DeFi, minting NFTs or just doing some other L2s action, this affects everyone.  This is important because even thought it could be a few persons doing it in really it is more probable that more users, more utility and more adoption is happening. It is not just whales moving ETH around. This is real, real engagement in whole Ethereum ecosystem. Showing again that Ethereum is not dead at all.  This again will not directly affect the price but somehow it is already doing it because those using Ethereum ecosystem probably believe in it and they will probably buy and HODL more.

I went and researched the data to get a better picture of Ethereums potential. In June I finished my analysis and summarised my findings in a report. (you can read it if you have the time, see link)  **In short:**  * Ethereum is the market leader (by far) in stablecoins, RWA and DeFi, even as the market grows fast. * Stablecoins are currently getting a lot of traction (see Circle and Genius Act in the US), and ETH will ride this wave. * Tokenization is also getting increasing hype and grew almost 440% in 18 months, again ETH will ride this wave (companies like Robinhood and Coinbase are working on their L2s to realize 24/7 stocks) * Ethereum operates largely under U.S. regulation, giving it the legitimacy and trust the big institutions need to adopt tokenized assets at scale * Institutions trust Ethereum’s security and are likely to pour more in ETH ETFs once staking funds arrive. * Over half of all ETH is now staked, cutting supply and showing strong conviction. * ETH/BTC is near historic lows, past cycles show this often marks a strong rebound. * Also on-chain data (like MVRV-Z score) suggests ETH is very low valued while growth drivers are still ahead.

ethtrader,1kduzyi,2025-05-03 15:02:24,His bold move saved Ethereum.,"Back in 2017 Vitalik Buterin, the big brain behind Ethereum, saw a disaster coming. Ethereum was his dream of a smarter blockchain, and it was in trouble. A thread on Twitter by StarPlatinum talks about this insane story, showing how Vitalik's decision to switch from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake saved crypto from a $100 billion collapse. I read the thread, and I will break it down.  Ethereum's PoW system was eating up too much energy, think 70 TWh a year by 2021. That is enough to power a small country by the way. There was a tremendous spike and Vitalik knew the network could not handle it. Another major problem was miners were getting too powerful. A pie chart in the original thread shows that just one pool, Dwarfpool, controlled 47.9% of the hashrate, creating centralization. Ethereum was supposed to be free, not a repeat of the old system.  Vitalik's fix was the Merge. In September 2022, Ethereum swapped its engine mid-flight, moving to PoS. Miners hated it and a lot of people still do. Miners would lose their gigs, but Vitalik pushed through. The Merge did a lot of great things, energy use dropped 99.95%, regular users gained more control and decentralization was saved. Despite the drama with developers and miners raging, Vitalik's bet paid off. Ethereum is still here, proving sometimes the hardest path is the right one.

ethtrader,1l9jvxu,2025-06-12 11:18:46,Is Ethereum's current price a hidden steal or a red flag?,"Ryan Sean Adams, the co-founder of Bankless, a crypto media brand, posted a tweet a couple days ago about Ethereum's journey in a year, from 2024 to 2025. A year ago ETH was near $3,700, and now it is sitting at $2,700. Ryan says it is a 'miracle' you can still snag it under $3,000. In the tweet he pointed to big wins like zero-knowledge rollups boosting scalability, the ETH ETF approval last year, and a seemingly crypto-friendly SEC shift. These things may change Ethereum for the better, rollups cut costs by up to 90% and there will probably be a softer regulatory stance. But is this optimism justified or are we missing the bigger picture??  Are we leaning toward skepticism?? Because while Bitcoin keeps going to new highs, Ethereum's price is lagging a lot. The biggest narrative Bitcoin maxis use against Ethereum is the uncapped supply which is diluting ETH's value. Demand might not keep up with issuance, and that may leave ETH vulnerable. Ryan's points are impressive, but my concern is crypto-wide SEC changes for the worst. Still, I believe Ethereum's dominance is slightly increasing and $2,700 could mean undervaluation from last year, it is a bargain. Investors should study Ethereum, understand it.

Yes, you hear it well, US government entirely talking about how embrace crypto and regulate it in a proper way. It feels like it's been 84 years since 2021 when crypto was for criminals and a scam right?  One of the things that got my attention is that they named a lot about stablecoins and this is what made me more bullish on Ethereum and its ecosystem. As you may know USDC and USDT are built on the Ethereum network and if stablecoins become the dominant form of digital dollars this will benefit Ethereum a lot. This will increase demand for the network to handle stablecoins transactions, generate gas fees that are paid in ETH, meaning more demand of ETH.

A few hours ago Etherealize posted on Twitter their written testimony for the hearing. Etherealize basically called Ethereum the gold standard for decentralized smart contract platforms. They say that Ethereum has been around for 10 years with no single entity controlling it, making it highly secure and resilient, unlike centralized systems that can crash if one part fails. They also say regulatory clarity, like the new CLARITY Act, could bring 100x more users, assets, and apps to the space by clearing up the messy oversight between agencies like the SEC and CFTC.  Decentralization should not be just a fancy word, it should be about real security and uptime, which Ethereum has absolutely. Etherealize's full statement goes even deeper, mentioning how Ethereum's tech like Distributed Validator Technology increases validator security and network resilience.

ethtrader,1m5dw26,2025-07-21 09:00:17,Why ETH might never be this cheap again,"ETH around these levels (~$3K–$3.5K) might be the last major accumulation zone we see before the next macro cycle shift. Here’s why I’m treating this range as a long-term floor.  First, Ethereum is no longer just a speculative asset. It’s the base layer for real activity — stablecoins, rollups, RWAs, and even ETFs. The network is settling trillions annually, and it’s doing that while burning supply. The merge flipped ETH’s supply dynamics permanently. Every time the network heats up, ETH becomes deflationary. That’s not just hype — it’s visible on-chain.  Second, institutional momentum is building. BlackRock’s ETH ETF isn’t a rumor anymore. It’s coming. The moment ETH becomes accessible through brokerage apps and retirement accounts, capital inflow pressure will ramp up quickly. That’s a shift in access, and once it happens, price tends to catch up fast.  Third, ETH’s L2 ecosystem is finally mature. DeFi is growing again. NFTs are stabilizing. New narratives like restaking and modular chains all flow back to Ethereum’s settlement layer. ETH isn’t just riding trends — it’s structurally tied to most of them.  Cycles don’t wait. By the time retail is confident enough to enter, ETH is usually already up 2x. If history repeats, buying ETH at $3K might look like buying it at $200 in early 2020.  Just because it feels quiet now doesn’t mean it’s dead. It usually means smart money is getting in before the next leg.

ethtrader,1mrx3ww,2025-08-16 14:39:02,Why ETH Will Outrun BTC (And Why It’s Already Worth $25k),"Alright fam, let’s talk real for a sec. Everyone and their grandma knows about Bitcoin—the OG crypto, the “digital gold,” the coin your uncle brings up at Christmas right before he tells you he “almost bought some in 2012.” Cool story, Bob.  But here’s the thing: BTC is basically a flex piece at this point. You hold it, you watch number go up (or down lol), and that’s it. It doesn’t do anything. It’s like the Pokémon card in your binder—rare, valuable, but you’re not playing a match with it.  Ethereum tho? Whole different vibe.   1. Utility > Hype  BTC = a vault. ETH = an engine. On ETH, you can:  Run DeFi (aka banking without the bank)  Buy/Sell NFTs (yeah, laugh if you want, but they literally redefined digital ownership)  Spin up DAOs (internet-native co-ops, basically communities with a shared wallet)  Build smart contracts (apps that never sleep, never rug you if coded right)   That’s like comparing a Nokia brick phone to an iPhone. One makes calls, the other runs your whole life.   2. ETH Is the Internet’s Native Currency  Think about it: ETH isn’t just a coin, it’s the fuel for the most used decentralized network in the world. Every major Web3 app? Built on Ethereum or forks of it. If the internet had an in-game currency, it wouldn’t be BTC, it would be ETH.    3. Institutions Are Loading ETH Bags  Here’s the real difference this bull run: Retail doesn’t even matter that much anymore. You don’t need TikTok teens or Elon tweets to pump ETH. Institutions are buying like absolute maniacs. Hedge funds, ETFs, banks—they’re scooping ETH like it’s the last PS5 on Black Friday.  Demand isn’t just hype-driven, it’s structural. They need ETH to build, to stake, to run products for their own clients. It’s literally getting absorbed by the financial system itself.  BTC is still waiting on “muh retail frenzy.” ETH is getting swallowed by Wall Street in real time.    4. Real Value ≠ Current Price  BTC’s price is inflated by brand recognition. ETH’s price is deflated because people still treat it like “that other coin.” But when you factor in what it actually powers + the institutional demand, ETH at $1.8k (or wherever it is rn) is literally clown world.  Real worth? $25,000 easy. Because ETH isn’t just digital oil anymore—it’s becoming the default settlement layer for the global economy.    5. ETH 2.0 = Game Over  Staking = passive income, network secured. Scalability upgrades = faster, cheaper. Ecosystem = growing non-stop.  Meanwhile BTC is just… chilling. No shade, but it’s like your dad refusing to download TikTok.    TLDR:  BTC = shiny rock you flex on Twitter.  ETH = digital oil, internet money, programmable money.  Institutions are buying ETH like hell, retail isn’t even required this cycle.  Real ETH value = $25k+ because it actually powers something.

ethtrader,1mp3a4q,2025-08-13 12:37:31,Guess what: ETH supply is getting squeezed.,"Here is a fun fact: ETH's supply crunch is accelerating and this is not getting enough attention. According to Etheraider on Twitter, ETH treasury strategies are on track to buy more than a decade's worth of ETH issuance in under a year only. Let's look at the numbers!! In the last 4 years Ethereum issued about 3.76 million ETH. In just the past 4 months Strategic ETH Reserve (SER) acquisitions have already reached 3.57 million ETH. If things keep going like this SER alone will get the equivalent of 11.39 years of new ETH supply in its first 12 months. This is not hopium or bullish sentiment, it is data and this data points to a structural shift. ETH's supply is already limited with staking and burning removing ETH from circulation. Now large-scale treasury strategies are taking over supply at a speed the network's issuance cannot match.  Etheraider's takeaway is: there is not enough ETH. Demand keeps rising in this bull phase and the market won't just be competing over new issuance, it will be fighting over what is already locked away. That kind of imbalance does not resolve quietly and we will see it in the price. If you have been waiting for a signal of scarcity then this is it. The clock on ETH's available supply is ticking down, well actually it is being fast-forwarded.  *Source: https://x.com/etheraider/status/1955469147573260428*",MasterpieceLoud4931,352,130,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1mp3a4q/guess_what_eth_supply_is_getting_squeezed/,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1mp3a4q/guess_what_eth_supply_is_getting_squeezed/,"Guess what: ETH supply is getting squeezed.

They are calling 2025 the year of Ethereum, predicting a massive rally to $10k. Yes, yes.. it sounds crazy, but bear with me, their reasoning makes sense. Ethereum has been kind of a letdown since 2021 even with Bitcoin going to $100k and ETH ETFs getting approved. Network activity has been lower than usual, partly because of competition from other L1s and Sui and even L2s have made gas fees so cheap that ETH burns are not happening much.  In addition to this Bitcoin's dominance has been very high, leaving ETH struggling to hit a new ATH. But that is changing this year, everything is changing. BlackRock has been meeting with the SEC about ETH staking and tokenization, and Ethereum dominates with around 60% of RWA total value locked. We had the Pectra upgrade recently which was huge and great for the price, and Vitalik is planning more upgrades to make Ethereum the biggest global settlement layer. As for stablecoins, Ethereum is handling over $122 billion in stablecoin supply, more than Visa last year. The US is working on the GENIUS Act, which will be great for stablecoin growth. So Ethereum is poised to win.  We should be very optimistic. If these catalysts hit, Ethereum could give us a massive altcoin rally.

He compares it to Bitcoin's boom in 2017, where retail hype turned into institutional inflows. I cannot help but wonder if he is onto something..  There has been a lot of hype around ETH lately, for example like Larry Fink from BlackRock hinting at on-chain securities and talks about national crypto reserves in different countries, mainly the US (already happening). It is crazy to think the 'degens' might be out of the game, sidelined by misinformation. I read somewhere that retail interest dropped 30% last year because of these psyops, leaving the door open for rich people with deep pockets who do not care about old Twitter beefs.  To be completely honest ETH's price has been boring lately, but its fundamentals are still strong, never forget that. If institutions really put trillions in, then $10k could happen. I am both skeptical and excited, maybe it is time to keep an eye on this sleeping titan guys. Those who do not know the difference between Ethereum and the other blockchains are the ones who will end up buying ETH at the top.

Donald Trump’s World Liberty Financial just bought another 3,350 ETH today, worth $110.6M. And they’re still buying.. literally by the minute. By the time this gets posted the total ETH bought today might be even higher. They’re accumulating during the dip, and they wouldn’t be constantly stacking up ETH in big amounts if they didn’t have big plans, or weren’t bullish on it.  In case you're curious, right now World Liberty Financial holds:  * 59,432 ETH * 646,715 WBTC (on Ethereum) * 19,408 STETH (staked on Lido) * 256,315 LINK * 19,399 AAVE * 5.78M ENA * Over $47.52M in stablecoins * And more...  Their total crypto holdings are over $391.3M, and the fact that they have millions in stablecoins is a signal they’re ready to buy even more. Meanwhile, shrimps on the internet are panic selling ETH for cheap, and WLFi is happily buying what they sell. Corporations don’t buy in bulk like this without a plan, something big is coming and they probably know something we don’t.  Luckily we can use blockchain transparency to our advantage. We can watch their wallets and corporative/whale wallets and track their movements. If we want to understand what’s actually happening in the market, we have to follow the money.

I know this is a sub for eth so you guys are obviously biased but do you see ETH as a long term investment or a short term play? Just looking for what you guys honestly think. I feel like ETH is kinda destined to hit like 6k and then drop afterwards. If you compare to 2021 cycle it's basically even, which makes me question ETH long term. (Unless you think that ETH cycle has really started yet)   My thoughts is that I think the blockchain is important however there is just so much competition between different cryptos and now institutions creating their own. And if institutions are just going to create there own blockchains off a fork of ETH, why is ETH important? Wouldn't you be better off with a blockchain ETF like BLOK? What makes ETH better than everyone else? What makes you think that ETH is going to survive?  Or if your a short term investor, do you plan on just selling soon and buying again during the bear market in a few years. Thanks!  And just for fun are you guys are you guys only in ETH?

In that tweet, Pentoshi talked about how public companies might soon buy enough ETH to offset all new coins created since the Merge. That is a game-changer especially since the Merge made Ethereum a lot better and accessible and made ETH a better choice for investing.  Right now ETH's market cap is just 1/9th of BTC, Pentoshi says a flood of capital could send it to the moon. He is telling us to stop tribalism and watch the trend unfold, more specifically to follow Fundstrat's steps. As I always say: follow the money. Corporate interest is growing, data confirms that it is.. but is this hype or reality?? Pentoshi said 'set your bias aside' which makes sense because too many of us are stuck on Bitcoin's throne.   In the tweet I mentioned there was someone making a counterpoint saying the old glory days of Ethereum (ICO etc) are over, and that stablecoins are Ethereum's only hope.

eth etfs just pulled in a ridiculous $727 million in a single day, and they've been on a 16-day inflow streak. that's not retail fomo, that's serious institutional money coming in. blackrock alone is sitting on $10.69 billion worth of eth and they're not slowing down.  what really caught my attention is how network activity has exploded. daily transactions jumped 73% to 1.62 million, and we're seeing 670k daily active addresses - that's a 12-month high. the defi tvl is back at $86 billion, which we haven't seen since 2022.  but here's what makes me think we're about to break through: eth supply on exchanges dropped to 15.6 million, the lowest since before the 2017 rally. when supply gets squeezed like this while demand is cranking up, things get spicy fast.  the technicals are screaming too. just broke out of a bull flag pattern with a target of $5k. that's a 30% move from here if it plays out.  companies are loading up their treasuries with eth left and right. bitmine just bought $2 billion worth in 16 days and became the biggest corporate holder. even galaxy's ceo is calling $4k and saying eth will outperform btc over the next six months. with all these potential gains stacking up, definitely worth getting your tax situation sorted early, tools like awaken.tax are clutch for tracking everything when these moves happen fast.  i know we've been burned before, but this feels like the real deal. the combination of institutional flow, corporate adoption, network growth, and supply squeeze is creating the perfect storm.  what do you guys think, are we finally going to see eth blast past $4k or is this just another fakeout?",hodorrny,232,67,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1mbrk7k/eth_about_to_smash_through_4k_after_three_failed/,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1mbrk7k/eth_about_to_smash_through_4k_after_three_failed/,"eth about to smash through $4k after three failed attempts cause this setup looks way too good to ignore so i've been watching eth dance around this $4k level since february and honestly, this time feels different. we've seen it get rejected three times already, but the stars are actually aligning now.  the numbers don't lie -

CryptoCurrency,1lsz4qg,2025-07-06 11:37:09,"Ethereum Is the Internet of Value | Bitcoin Is Gold, But ETH Is Fueling the Future - DeFi, DAOs, RWAs, L2s and More.","Just crossed with this really interesting Leon [Tweet ](https://x.com/LeonWaidmann/status/1941496285506437375)about that Ethereum and Bitcoin can not be compared, something that I have been telling for ages, they are different things.  Ethereum is not just another crypto, it is the backbone of the decentralized future. It is programmable money, the infrastructure for DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, Layer 2s, Real World Assets (RWAs), stablecoins and a much more.  Furthermore, all the decisions made by Ethereum ecosystem have been made to make Ethereum like it is today and to become what it is going to become. Since the shift to Proof of Stake, ETH is not low energy, yield generating and even deflationary at times with high activity. It is also really usable now with the blobs upgrade that even thought it increased inflation for a while it has drastically reduced gas fees and made Ethereum scalable for when it becomes mainstream and the whole world starts using it, making it again deflationary without no doubt. Holding ETH is like holding a piece of a decentralized Internet.  In the other hand we have Bitcoin, yes, it is the OG and respect to that. It has a fixed supply and no frills, lets call it Digital Gold. However it is ""static"". You can't build apps on it like Ethereum. No smart contracts, no ecosystem of dApps, no yield unless you take extra risk elsewhere.  While Bitcoin is digital gold, Ethereum is digital oil, fueling a whole economy of innovation, experimentation and value creation.  Thousands of devs are building the future of Ethereum, from zk rollups to real world assets and the platform where this happen is Ethereum.

Just crossed with this really interesting Leon [Tweet ](https://x.com/LeonWaidmann/status/1941496285506437375)about that Ethereum and Bitcoin can not be compared, something that I have been telling for ages, they are different things.  Ethereum is not just another crypto, it is the backbone of the decentralized future. It is programmable money, the infrastructure for DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, Layer 2s, Real World Assets (RWAs), stablecoins and a much more.  Furthermore, all the decisions made by Ethereum ecosystem have been made to make Ethereum like it is today and to become what it is going to become. Since the shift to Proof of Stake, ETH is not low energy, yield generating and even deflationary at times with high activity. It is also really usable now with the blobs upgrade that even thought it increased inflation for a while it has drastically reduced gas fees and made Ethereum scalable for when it becomes mainstream and the whole world starts using it, making it again deflationary without no doubt. Holding ETH is like holding a piece of a decentralized Internet.  In the other hand we have Bitcoin, yes, it is the OG and respect to that. It has a fixed supply and no frills, lets call it Digital Gold. However it is ""static"". You can't build apps on it like Ethereum. No smart contracts, no ecosystem of dApps, no yield unless you take extra risk elsewhere.  While Bitcoin is digital gold, Ethereum is digital oil, fueling a whole economy of innovation, experimentation and value creation.  Thousands of devs are building the future of Ethereum, from zk rollups to real world assets and the platform where this happen is Ethereum. Anyway, both are totally different things with totally different purposes so its a good way to ""diversify"".

I expect there will be a bit more of a tug of war before the next break out.  In the last 30 days, ETH is +46% while the market leader, BTC, is just +1%.  From 0.025 to 0.036 in the ETH/BTC ratio.  In the last 90 days, ETH is +71% the market leader, BTC, is +11%.  We can see from the graph and stats below, ETH dominance has risen quite nicely compared to the rest of the market.  [Coin Dominance Change Since May 2025 - Graph](https://preview.redd.it/b8jgo7t5h3if1.png?width=1261&format=png&auto=webp&s=2bdc81eb7a3f886fe60e3b49e4e0ae6a2f06bf7d)  This data reflected by the graph.

Should history rhyme, ETH will continue to out-perform the market leader for another period of time, until the markets become euphoric and we enter the alt-season.

I expect there will be a bit more of a tug of war before the next break out.  In the last 30 days, ETH is +46% while the market leader, BTC, is just +1%.  From 0.025 to 0.036 in the ETH/BTC ratio.  In the last 90 days, ETH is +71% the market leader, BTC, is +11%.  We can see from the graph and stats below, ETH dominance has risen quite nicely compared to the rest of the market.

CryptoMarkets,1n0yd9e,2025-08-26 21:24:09,Ethereum Begins to Step Out of Bitcoin’s Shadow,"Over the past few months, the relationship between Bitcoin and Ethereum has started to look different from what the market has grown used to in previous cycles. Historically, Bitcoin has always acted as the anchor, setting the pace for the entire digital asset space. When Bitcoin surged, altcoins followed, and when it corrected, the rest of the market almost always lost steam. This time, however, Ethereum is beginning to show signs that it can sustain its own momentum even when Bitcoin softens.  Bitcoin recently slid to levels not seen in close to two months, giving back gains made during its strong August rally. In earlier years, such a retreat would normally drag the broader market down with it. Yet, instead of fading, Ethereum has gained renewed attention. Traders have been quick to position themselves around Ether, which touched a new record near US$4,955, a level that has shifted sentiment across the market.  One of the clearest indications of this shift comes from institutional flows. Exchange traded funds that track Bitcoin posted heavy outflows in August, with more than US$1 billion leaving those products. At the same time, Ether linked funds moved in the opposite direction, attracting around US$3.3 billion. Such a wide gap points to more than short term trading. It reflects a deliberate change in investor preference, where capital is beginning to migrate toward Ethereum as a primary holding rather than a secondary one.  The story, however, is not entirely one sided. Developments within the Bitcoin ecosystem are also drawing attention. The upcoming rollout of Bitlayer V2, which integrates Bitcoin native rollups, is expected to follow listings on large centralized exchanges such as Bitget. Alongside that, the introduction of BitVM, a model allowing EVM style smart contracts to function on the Bitcoin network, could create new ways for liquidity to remain within Bitcoin’s DeFi framework. These upgrades may help Bitcoin defend its long standing dominance.  Even so, what makes this market moment unique is the fact that Ethereum is finally being recognized as more than just a secondary option. Several growth drivers are working in its favor at once. Consistent inflows into Ether ETFs, rising demand for staking as a yield generating mechanism, and the rapid expansion of tokenized real world assets on its network are all contributing to its strength. Taken together, these factors suggest that Ethereum’s trajectory no longer needs to mirror Bitcoin’s in lockstep.

While most people are chasing meme rotations or just watching Bitcoin stay flat, ETH spot ETFs have now recorded 16 straight days of inflows. Just on Friday alone, they pulled in 453 million dollars. And that is not random. Someone is clearly building a position.  It’s not even evenly spread. BlackRock’s ETHA brought in 440 million dollars on its own that day. One fund.

After that Bitwise and Fidelity followed with inflows of around 10 million and 7 million while Grayscale’s ETHE is still bleeding though. It lost another 23 million on Friday.

In addition to trading services, Wurster revealed that Schwab plans to launch a stablecoin. He said the firm is exploring multiple pathways to deliver this stablecoin. This suggests openness to partnerships, in-house development, or leveraging existing blockchain infrastructure.  “Stablecoins are likely to play a role in transacting on blockchains, and that’s something we do want to be able to offer,” he said. “We will have a stablecoin at some point.”  The statement comes after the GENIUS Act,  which is meant to regulate stablecoins, was passed on Thursday by the US House.",DreamingTooLong,22,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1m3cmt4/charles_schwab_to_launch_bitcoin_and_ethereum/,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1m3cmt4/charles_schwab_to_launch_bitcoin_and_ethereum/,"Charles Schwab to Launch Bitcoin and Ethereum Trading Charles Schwab, the US brokerage firm with $10.7 trillion under management, is set to roll out spot Bitcoin and Ethereum trading.

CryptoMarkets,1i87rzr,2025-01-23 16:48:43,"Movement is a Move-based blockchain network that seeks to improve the security, speed and efficiency of Ethereum","It works as a layer 2 (L2) solution on top of Ethereum, which means it processes transactions faster and cheaper without compromising security.  Here's a summary of what Movement offers for Ethereum:  * Move programming language: Movement uses the Move programming language, originally developed by Facebook (Meta). Move is designed to be more secure and efficient than Solidity, the most widely used language in Ethereum.  * It uses a resource-oriented programming model, where digital assets are treated as unique resources with strict rules about their creation and transfer. This reduces common vulnerabilities such as re-entry, overflows and underflows.  * Integrates Move Prover, a formal verification tool that analyzes code mathematically to detect vulnerabilities.  MoveVM: Movement uses the Move Virtual Machine (MoveVM), which is compatible with Move code and also with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) bytecode. This allows:    * Developers to deploy existing Solidity contracts on the MoveVM without the need to rewrite them in Move.  * Ethereum applications can take advantage of Move's security and efficiency without having to leave the Ethereum ecosystem.  * MoveVM enables parallel transaction execution, increasing performance and scalability, reaching up to 180,000 TPS.  M2: The main Movement layer 2 in Ethereum, also known as the first MEVM (Move + EVM) ZK L2 ZK in Ethereum, powered by Celestia.  Move rollups: Movement offers a flexible architecture where developers can create custom rollups for different applications such as DeFi, games or supply chains. These rollups can be optimistic (fraud proof) or zero-knowledge (validity proof).  Decentralized Shared Sequencer (DSS): Movement uses a decentralized sequencer that ensures fair and uncensored transaction processing. The DSS also facilitates interoperability between different blockchains within the Movement ecosystem.  Fast Finality Settlement Module: Movement uses a novel mechanism for fast transaction settlement. This module uses a network of validators that stake and certify the correctness of state changes, ensuring security and reducing latency.  Interoperability: Movement seeks interoperability by combining the EVM and Move ecosystem, creating a deep liquidity hub. In addition, it is compatible with other blockchain networks.  Move Stack: A set of tools, components and adapters that enable the creation of customizable Move-based blockchains. The Move Stack allows developers to select the most appropriate components for their applications, ensuring optimal performance and security.  Movement is an innovative network that seeks to empower Ethereum with the security and efficiency of the Move language, while maintaining compatibility with existing Ethereum applications. It offers a scalable solution for developers and users seeking a faster, cheaper and more secure experience in the blockchain ecosystem.

CryptoMarkets,1mbh8g8,2025-07-28 14:10:48,What if the ETH sell-off never comes this cycle?,"In previous cycles, we've seen a familiar pattern: ETH gains momentum, retail floods in, price peaks... and then the sell-off hits. The cycle (usually) repeats, but this time feels different.  SharpLink just accumulated over 438K ETH, making it the largest corporate ETH holder. BitMine's been scaling aggressively too. ETH ETF flows are exploding - $2.4B in just six trading days - and open interest is at all-time highs. Meanwhile, ETH dominance just hit 12% for the first time in five years.  In the past, people would sell into strength to take profits. But institutions don't trade that way - they're not rotating out at $4K or $5K - they're buying with multi-year horizons, using ETH for treasuries, staking, and long-term yield.  So here's the question: If the biggest players this cycle are accumulating, staking, and locking ETH into ETFs... is the sell-off even coming? And if it doesn't come, how are you planning to play it?  Some are stacking, some are earning passive yield, and some are borrowing against ETH using platforms like Nexo instead of selling at all. If ETH is really shifting into institutional asset territory, short-term exit plans might need a rethink.  So maybe this isn't just another retail-driven boom/bust setup.

Then I tried margin trading (big mistake), got liquidated, and was left staring at an empty account. Honestly, I almost quit.  In 2019, I decided to stop gambling and start learning. I studied charts, watched real traders, read books, and backtested strategies. I didn’t trade real money for a while—just practiced and journaled everything.

But I got cocky, messed with leverage again, and gave back a chunk. That lesson hurt, but it stuck.  2022 was survival mode.

After months of being frustrated trying to find the right place to track crypto ETF flows (without relying on scattered Twitter posts and random charts), I decided to build something myself.  **💡 Why I Made Thi**s  Institutional investment in crypto is growing, and ETFs are a major driver of capital flow. But tracking inflows and outflows isn’t easy. Most of the data is buried in reports or shared sporadically on Twitter.  I wanted a clean, real-time dashboard that makes it easy to see and track trends over time. Whether you’re a trader, investor, or just an internet cat wanting to see how institutional money is moving, this tool can help.  The other interesting item of note here is I have 0 coding experience. As of 2 week ago, I had never written a line of code in my life.

After months of being frustrated trying to find the right place to track crypto ETF flows (without relying on scattered Twitter posts and random charts), I decided to build something myself.  **💡 Why I Made Thi**s  Institutional investment in crypto is growing, and ETFs are a major driver of capital flow. But tracking inflows and outflows isn’t easy. Most of the data is buried in reports or shared sporadically on Twitter.  I wanted a clean, real-time dashboard that makes it easy to see and track trends over time. Whether you’re a trader, investor, or just an internet cat wanting to see how institutional money is moving, this tool can help.  The other interesting item of note here is I have 0 coding experience. As of 2 week ago, I had never written a line of code in my life.

A lot of ETH was lent or allocated off-exchange to bootstrap rollups like Matic, Optimism, Arbitrum, StarkNet, etc. The goal was vertical scaling and more transaction throughput without stressing mainnet.  But here’s the issue: most of these L2s didn’t take off. Real usage is weak. Most activity is short-term (airdrops, farming), and their tokens are easy to manipulate, low market cap, thin liquidity. That made it tempting to artificially pump them and inflate transaction volume, which gets mirrored back onto Ethereum mainnet as if it’s legit demand. It’s not.  Meanwhile, ETH is locked in staking or buried in contracts, so there's no real spot pressure. No liquidation risk, no reflexive price movement. Smart money saw the setup and shorted.
